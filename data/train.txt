this is bill lange i 'm dave gallo
and we 're going to tell you some stories from the sea here in video
we 've got some of the most incredible video of titanic that 's ever been seen and we 're not going to show you any of it
the truth of the matter is that the titanic even though it 's breaking all sorts of box office records it 's not the most exciting story from the sea
and the problem i think is that we take the ocean for granted
when you think about it the oceans are 75 percent of the planet
most of the planet is ocean water
the average depth is about two miles
part of the problem i think is we stand at the beach or we see images like this of the ocean and you look out at this great big blue expanse and it 's shimmering and it 's moving and there 's waves and there 's surf and there 's tides but you have no idea for what lies in there
and in the oceans there are the longest mountain ranges on the planet
most of the animals are in the oceans
most of the earthquakes and volcanoes are in the sea at the bottom of the sea
the biodiversity and the biodensity in the ocean is higher in places than it is in the rainforests
it 's mostly unexplored and yet there are beautiful sights like this that captivate us and make us become familiar with it
but when you 're standing at the beach i want you to think that you 're standing at the edge of a very unfamiliar world
we have to have a very special technology to get into that unfamiliar world
we use the submarine alvin and we use cameras and the cameras are something that bill lange has developed with the help of sony
marcel proust said the true voyage of discovery is not so much in seeking new landscapes as in having new eyes
people that have partnered with us have given us new eyes not only on what exists the new landscapes at the bottom of the sea but also how we think about life on the planet itself
here 's a jelly
it 's one of my favorites because it 's got all sorts of working parts
this turns out to be the longest creature in the oceans
it gets up to about 150 feet long
but see all those different working things
i love that kind of stuff
it 's got these fishing lures on the bottom they 're going up and down
it 's got tentacles dangling swirling around like that
it 's a colonial animal
these are all individual animals banding together to make this one creature
and it 's got these jet thrusters up in front that it 'll use in a moment and a little light
if you take all the big fish and schooling fish and all that put them on one side of the scale put all the jelly-type of animals on the other side those guys win hands down
most of the biomass in the ocean is made out of creatures like this
here 's the x-wing death jelly
the bioluminescence they use the lights for attracting mates and attracting prey and communicating
we couldn 't begin to show you our archival stuff from the jellies
they come in all different sizes and shapes
we tend to forget about the fact that the ocean is miles deep on average and that we 're real familiar with the animals that are in the first 200 or 300 feet but we 're not familiar with what exists from there all the way down to the bottom
and these are the types of animals that live in that three-dimensional space that micro-gravity environment that we really haven 't explored
you hear about giant squid and things like that but some of these animals get up to be approximately 140 160 feet long
they 're very little understood
this is one of them another one of our favorites because it 's a little octopod
you can actually see through his head
and here he is flapping with his ears and very gracefully going up
we see those at all depths and even at the greatest depths
they go from a couple of inches to a couple of feet
they come right up to the submarine they 'll put their eyes right up to the window and peek inside the sub
this is really a world within a world and we 're going to show you two
in this case we 're passing down through the mid-ocean and we see creatures like this
this is kind of like an undersea rooster
this guy that looks incredibly formal in a way
and then one of my favorites what a face
this is basically scientific data that you 're looking at
it 's footage that we 've collected for scientific purposes
and that 's one of the things that bill 's been doing is providing scientists with this first view of animals like this in the world where they belong
they don 't catch them in a net
they 're actually looking at them down in that world
we 're going to take a joystick sit in front of our computer on the earth and press the joystick forward and fly around the planet
we 're going to look at the mid-ocean ridge a 40,000-mile long mountain range
the average depth at the top of it is about a mile and a half
and we 're over the atlantic that 's the ridge right there but we 're going to go across the caribbean central america and end up against the pacific nine degrees north
we make maps of these mountain ranges with sound with sonar and this is one of those mountain ranges
we 're coming around a cliff here on the right
the height of these mountains on either side of this valley is greater than the alps in most cases
and there 's tens of thousands of those mountains out there that haven 't been mapped yet
this is a volcanic ridge
we 're getting down further and further in scale
and eventually we can come up with something like this
this is an icon of our robot jason it 's called
and you can sit in a room like this with a joystick and a headset and drive a robot like that around the bottom of the ocean in real time
one of the things we 're trying to do at woods hole with our partners is to bring this virtual world this world this unexplored region back to the laboratory
because we see it in bits and pieces right now
we see it either as sound or we see it as video or we see it as photographs or we see it as chemical sensors but we never have yet put it all together into one interesting picture
here 's where bill 's cameras really do shine
this is what 's called a hydrothermal vent
and what you 're seeing here is a cloud of densely packed hydrogen-sulfide-rich water coming out of a volcanic axis on the sea floor
gets up to 600 700 degrees f somewhere in that range
so that 's all water under the sea a mile and a half two miles three miles down
and we knew it was volcanic back in the 60s 70s
and then we had some hint that these things existed all along the axis of it because if you 've got volcanism water 's going to get down from the sea into cracks in the sea floor come in contact with magma and come shooting out hot
we weren 't really aware that it would be so rich with sulfides hydrogen sulfides
we didn 't have any idea about these things which we call chimneys
this is one of these hydrothermal vents
six hundred degree f water coming out of the earth
on either side of us are mountain ranges that are higher than the alps so the setting here is very dramatic
the white material is a type of bacteria that thrives at 180 degrees c .
i think that 's one of the greatest stories right now that we 're seeing from the bottom of the sea is that the first thing we see coming out of the sea floor after a volcanic eruption is bacteria
and we started to wonder for a long time how did it all get down there
what we find out now is that it 's probably coming from inside the earth
not only is it coming out of the earth so biogenesis made from volcanic activity but that bacteria supports these colonies of life
the pressure here is 4,000 pounds per square inch
a mile and a half from the surface to two miles to three miles no sun has ever gotten down here
all the energy to support these life forms is coming from inside the earth so chemosynthesis
and you can see how dense the population is
these are called tube worms
these worms have no digestive system they have no mouth
but they have two types of gill structures
one for extracting oxygen out of the deep-sea water another one which houses this chemosynthetic bacteria which takes the hydrothermal fluid that hot water that you saw coming out of the bottom and converts that into simple sugars that the tube worm can digest
you can see here 's a crab that lives down there
he 's managed to grab a tip of these worms
now they normally retract as soon as a crab touches them
oh good going
so as soon as a crab touches them they retract down into their shells just like your fingernails
there 's a whole story being played out here that we 're just now beginning to have some idea of because of this new camera technology
these worms live in a real temperature extreme
their foot is at about 200 degrees c and their head is out at three degrees c so it 's like having your hand in boiling water and your foot in freezing water
that 's how they like to live
this is a female of this kind of worm
and here 's a male
you watch it doesn 't take long before two guys here this one and one that will show up over here start to fight
everything you see is played out in the pitch black of the deep sea
there are never any lights there except the lights that we bring
here they go
on one of the last dive series we counted 200 species in these areas 198 were new new species
one of the big problems is that for the biologists working at these sites it 's rather difficult to collect these animals
and they disintegrate on the way up so the imagery is critical for the science
two octopods at about two miles depth
this pressure thing really amazes me that these animals can exist there at a depth with pressure enough to crush the titanic like an empty pepsi can
what we saw up till now was from the pacific
this is from the atlantic even greater depth
you can see this shrimp is harassing this poor little guy here and he 'll bat it away with his claw whack
and the same thing 's going on over here
what they 're getting at is that on the back of this crab the foodstuff here is this very strange bacteria that lives on the backs of all these animals
and what these shrimp are trying to do is actually harvest the bacteria from the backs of these animals
and the crabs don 't like it at all
these long filaments that you see on the back of the crab are actually created by the product of that bacteria
so the bacteria grows hair on the crab
on the back you see this again
the red dot is the laser light of the submarine alvin to give us an idea about how far away we are from the vents
those are all shrimp
you see the hot water over here here and here coming out
they 're clinging to a rock face and actually scraping bacteria off that rock face
here 's a tiny little vent that 's come out of the side of that pillar
those pillars get up to several stories
so here you 've got this valley with this incredible alien landscape of pillars and hot springs and volcanic eruptions and earthquakes inhabited by these very strange animals that live only on chemical energy coming out of the ground
they don 't need the sun at all
you see this white v-shaped mark on the back of the shrimp
it 's actually a light-sensing organ
it 's how they find the hydrothermal vents
the vents are emitting a black body radiation an ir signature and so they 're able to find these vents at considerable distances
all this stuff is happening along that 40,000-mile long mountain range that we 're calling the ribbon of life because just even today as we speak there 's life being generated there from volcanic activity
this is the first time we 've ever tried this any place
we 're going to try to show you high definition from the pacific
we 're moving up one of these pillars
this one 's several stories tall
in it you 'll see that it 's a habitat for a lot of different animals
there 's a funny kind of hot plate here with vent water coming out of it
so all of these are individual homes for worms
now here 's a closer view of that community
here 's crabs here worms here
there are smaller animals crawling around
here 's pagoda structures
i think this is the neatest-looking thing
i just can 't get over this that you 've got these little chimneys sitting here smoking away
this stuff is toxic as hell by the way
you could never get a permit to dump this in the ocean and it 's coming out all from it
it 's unbelievable it 's basically sulfuric acid and it 's being just dumped out at incredible rates
and animals are thriving and we probably came from here
that 's probably where we evolved from
this bacteria that we 've been talking about turns out to be the most simplest form of life found
there are a number of groups that are proposing that life evolved at these vent sites
although the vent sites are short-lived an individual site may last only 10 years or so as an ecosystem they 've been stable for millions well billions of years
it works too well you see there 're some fish inside here as well
there 's a fish sitting here
here 's a crab with his claw right at the end of that tube worm waiting for that worm to stick his head out
the biologists right now cannot explain why these animals are so active
the worms are growing inches per week
i already said that this site from a human perspective is toxic as hell
not only that but on top the lifeblood that plumbing system turns off every year or so
their plumbing system turns off so the sites have to move
and then there 's earthquakes and then volcanic eruptions on the order of one every five years that completely wipes the area out
despite that these animals grow back in about a year 's time
you 're talking about biodensities and biodiversity again higher than the rainforest that just springs back to life
is it sensitive yes
is it fragile no it 's not really very fragile
i 'll end up with saying one thing
there 's a story in the sea in the waters of the sea in the sediments and the rocks of the sea floor
it 's an incredible story
what we see when we look back in time in those sediments and rocks is a record of earth history
everything on this planet everything works by cycles and rhythms
the continents move apart they come back together
oceans come and go mountains come and go glaciers come and go
el nino comes and goes it 's not a disaster it 's rhythmic
what we 're learning now it 's almost like a symphony
it 's just like music it really is just like music
and what we 're learning now is that you can 't listen to a five-billion-year long symphony get to today and say stop we want tomorrow 's note to be the same as it was today
it 's absurd it 's just absurd
so what we 've got to learn now is to find out where this planet 's going at all these different scales and work with it
learn to manage it
the concept of preservation is futile
conservation 's tougher but we can probably get there
thank you very much
thank you
i 'm here today to start a revolution
now before you get up in arms or you break into song or you pick a favorite color i want to define what i mean by revolution
by revolution i mean a drastic and far-reaching change in the way we think and behave the way we think and the way we behave
now why steve why do we need a revolution
we need a revolution because things aren 't working they 're just not working
and that makes me really sad because i 'm sick and tired of things not working
you know i 'm sick and tired of us not living up to our potential
i 'm sick and tired of us being last
and we are last place in so many things for example social factors
we 're last place in europe in innovation
there we are right at the end right at the bottom last place as a culture that doesn 't value innovation
we 're last place in health care and that 's important for a sense of well-being
and there we are not just last in the e.u. we 're last in europe at the very bottom
and worst of all it just came out three weeks ago many of you have seen it the economist
we 're the saddest place on earth relative to gdp per capita the saddest place on earth
that 's social let 's look at education
where do we rank three weeks ago in another report by the oecd
last in reading math and science last
business the lowest perception in the e.u.
that entrepreneurs provide benefits to society
why as a result what happens
the lowest percentage of entrepreneurs starting businesses
and this is despite the fact that everybody knows that small business is the engine of economies
we hire the most people we create the most taxes
so if our engine 's broken guess what
last in europe gdp per capita
last
so it 's no surprise guys that 62 percent of bulgarians are not optimistic about the future
we 're unhappy we have bad education and we have the worst businesses
and these are facts guys
this isn 't story tale it 's not make-believe
it 's not
it 's not a conspiracy i have got against bulgaria these are facts
so i think it should be really really clear that our system is broken
the way we think the way we behave our operating system of behaving is broken
we need a drastic change in the way we think and behave to transform bulgaria for the better for ourselves for our friends for our family and for our future
how did this happen
let 's be positive now we 're going to get positive how did this happen
i think we 're last because and this is going to be drastic to some of you because we are handicapping ourselves
we 're holding ourselves back because we don 't value play
i said play all right
in case some of you forgot what play is this is what play looks like
babies play kids play adults play
we don 't value play
in fact we devalue play
and we devalue it in three areas
let 's go back to the same three areas
social 45 years of what
of communism of valuing the society and the state over the individual and squashing inadvertently creativity individual self-expression and innovation
and instead what do we value
because it 's shown the way we apply generate and use knowledge is affected by our social and institutional context which told us what in communism
to be serious
to be really really serious
it did
be serious
i can 't tell you how many times i 've been scolded in the park for letting my kids play on the ground
heaven forbid they play in the dirt the kal or even worse lokvi water that will kill them
i have been told by babas and dyados that we shouldn 't let our kids play so much because life is serious and we need to train them for the seriousness of life
we have a serious meme running through
it 's a social gene running through us
it 's a serious gene
it 's 45 years of it that 's created what i call the baba factor
and here 's how it works
step one woman says i want to have a baby iskam baby
step two we get the baby woohoo
but then what happens in step three
i want to go back to work because i need to further my career or i just want to go have coffees
i 'm going to give bebko to baba
but we need to remember that baba 's been infected by the serious meme for 45 years
so what happens
she passes that virus on to baby and it takes a really really really long time as the redwood trees for that serious meme to get out of our operating system
what happens then
it goes into education where we have an antiquated education system that has little changed for 100 years that values rote learning memorization and standardization and devalues self-expression self-exploration questioning creativity and play
it 's a crap system
true story i went looking for a school for my kid
we went to this prestigious little school and they say they 're going to study math 10 times a week and science eight times a week and reading five times a day and all this stuff
and we said well what about play and recess
and they said ha there won 't be a single moment in the schedule
and we said he 's five
what a crime what a crime
and it 's a crime that our education system is so serious because education is serious that we 're creating mindless robotic workers to put bolts in pre-drilled holes
but i 'm sorry the problems of today are not the problems of the industrial revolution
we need adaptability the ability to learn how to be creative and innovative
we don 't need mechanized workers
but no now our meme goes into work where we don 't value play
we create robotic workers that we treat like assets to lever and just throw away
what are qualities of a bulgarian work
autocratic do what i say because i 'm the chef
i 'm the boss and i know better than you
untrusting you 're obviously a criminal so i 'm going to install cameras
controlling you 're obviously an idiot so i 'm going to make a zillion little processes for you to follow so you don 't step out of the box
so they 're restrictive don 't use your mobile phone don 't use your laptop don 't search the internet don 't be on i.m.
that 's somehow unprofessional and bad
and at the end of the day it 's unfulfilling because you 're controlled you 're restricted you 're not valued and you 're not having any fun
in social in education and in our business don 't value play
and that 's why we 're last because we don 't value play
and you can say that 's ridiculous steve what a dumb idea
it can 't be because of play
just play that 's a stupid thing
we have the serious meme in us
well i 'm going to say no
and i will prove it to you in the next part of the speech that play is the catalyst it is the revolution that we can use to transform bulgaria for the better
play our brains are hardwired for play
evolution has selected over millions and billions of years for play in animals and in humans
and you know what
evolution does a really really good job of deselecting traits that aren 't advantageous to us and selecting traits for competitive advantage
nature isn 't stupid and it selected for play
throughout the animal kingdom for example ants ants play
maybe you didn 't know that
but when they 're playing they 're learning the social order and dynamics of things
rats play but what you might not have known is that rats that play more have bigger brains and they learn tasks better skills
kittens play we all know kittens play
but what you may not know is that kittens deprived of play are unable to interact socially
they can still hunt but they can 't be social
bears play
but what you may not know is that bears that play more survive longer
it 's not the bears that learn how to fish better
it 's the ones that play more
and a final really interesting study it 's been shown a correlation between play and brain size
the more you play the bigger the brains there are
dolphins pretty big brains play a lot
but who do you think with the biggest brains are the biggest players
yours truly humans
kids play we play of every nationality of every race of every color of every religion
it 's a universal thing we play
and it 's not just kids it 's adults too
really cool term neoteny the retention of play and juvenile traits in adults
and who are the biggest neotenists
humans we play sports
we do it for fun or as olympians or as professionals
we play musical instruments
we dance we kiss we sing we just goof around
we 're designed by nature to play from birth to old age
we 're designed to do that continuously to play and play a lot and not stop playing
it is a huge benefit
just like there 's benefits to animals there 's benefits to humans
for example it 's been shown to stimulate neural growth in the amygdala in the area where it controls emotions
it 's been shown to promote pre-frontal cortex development where a lot of cognition is happening
as a result what happens
we develop more emotional maturity if we play more
we develop better decision-making ability if we play more
these guys are facts
it 's not fiction it 's not story tales it 's not make-believe it 's cold hard science
these are the benefits to play
it is a genetic birthright that we have like walking or speaking or seeing
and if we handicap ourselves with play we handicap ourselves as if we would with any other birthright that we have
we hold ourselves back
little exercise just for a second close your eyes and try to imagine a world without play
imagine a world without theater without the arts without song without dancing without soccer without football without laughter
what does this world look like
it 's pretty bleak
it 's pretty glum
now imagine your workplace
is it fun is it playful
or maybe the workplace of your friends here we 're forward thinking
is it fun is it playful
or is it crap is it autocratic controlling restrictive and untrusting and unfulfilling
we have this concept that the opposite of play is work
we even feel guilty if we 're seen playing at work
oh my colleagues see me laughing i must not have enough work or oh i 've got to hide because my boss might see me
he 's going to think i 'm not working hard
but i have news for you our thinking is backwards
the opposite of play is not work
the opposite of play is depression it 's depression
in fact play improves our work
just like there 's benefits for humans and animals there 's benefits for play at work
for example it stimulates creativity
it increases our openness to change
it improves our ability to learn
it provides a sense of purpose and mastery two key motivational things that increase productivity through play
so before you start thinking of play as just not serious play doesn 't mean frivolous
you know the professional athlete that loves skiing he 's serious about it but he loves it
he 's having fun he 's in the groove he 's in the flow
a doctor might be serious but laughter 's still a great medicine
our thinking is backwards
we shouldn 't be feeling guilty
we should be celebrating play
quick example from the corporate world
fedex easy motto people service profit
if you treat your people like people if you treat them great they 're happier they 're fulfilled they have a sense of mastery and purpose
what happens they give better service not worse but better
and when customers call for service and they 're dealing with happy people that can make decisions and are fulfilled how do the customers feel they feel great
and what do great customers do great-feeling customers
they buy more of your service and they tell more of their friends which leads to more profit
people service profit
play increases productivity not decreases
and you 're going to say gee that can work for fedex out there in the united states but it can 't work in bulgaria
no way we 're different
it does work in bulgaria you guys two reasons
one play is universal
there 's nothing weird about bulgarians that we can 't play besides the serious meme that we have to kick out
two i 've tried it i 've tried at sciant
when i got there we had zero happy customers
not one customer would refer us
i asked them all
we had marginal profit i did
we had marginal profits and we had unhappy stakeholders
through some basic change change like improving transparency change like promoting self-direction and collaboration encouraging collaboration not autocracy the things like having a results-focus
i don 't care when you get in in the morning i don 't care when you leave
i care that your customer and your team is happy and you 're organized with that
why do i care if you get in at nine o 'clock
basically promoting fun
through promoting fun and a great environment we were able to transform sciant and in just three short years sounds like a long time but change is slow every customer from zero to every customer referring us above average profits for the industry and happy stakeholders
and you can say well how do you know they 're happy
well we did win every year that we entered one of the rankings for best employer for small business
independent analysis from anonymous employees on their surveys
it does and it can work in bulgaria
there 's nothing holding us back except our own mentality about play
so some steps that we can take to finish up how to make this revolution through play
first of all you have to believe me
if you don 't believe me well just go home and think about it some more or something
second of all if you don 't have the feeling of play in you you need to rediscover play
whatever it was that as a kid you used to enjoy that you enjoyed only six months ago but now that you 've got that promotion you can 't enjoy because you feel like you have to be serious rediscover it
i don 't care if it 's mountain biking or reading a book or playing a game
rediscover that because you 're the leaders the innovation leaders the thought leaders
you 're the ones that have to go back to the office or talk to your friends and ignite the fire of change in the play revolution
you guys have to and if you 're not feeling it your colleagues your employees aren 't going to feel it
you 've got to go back and say hey i 'm going to trust you
weird concept i hired you i should trust you
i 'm going to let you make decisions i 'm going to empower you and i 'm going to delegate to the lowest level rather than the top
i 'm going to encourage constructive criticism
i 'm going to let you challenge authority
because it 's by challenging the way things are always done is that we are able to break out of the rut that we 're in and create innovative solutions to problems of today
we 're not always right as leaders
we 're going to eradicate fear
fear is the enemy of play
and we 're going to do things like eliminate restrictions
you know what let them use their mobile phone for personal calls heaven forbid
let them be on the internet
let them be on instant messengers
let them take long lunches
lunch is like the recess for work
it 's when you go out in the world and you recharge your brain you meet your friends you have a beer you have some food you talk you get some synergy of ideas that maybe you wouldn 't have had before
let them do it give them some freedom and in general let them play let them have fun at the workplace
we spend so much of our lives at the workplace and it 's supposed to be what a miserable grind so that 20 years from now we wake up and say is this it
is that all there was
unacceptable nepriemliv
so in summary we need a drastic change in the way we think and behave but we don 't need a workers revolution
we don 't need a workers revolution
what we need is a players uprising
what we need is a players uprising
what we need is a players uprising
seriously we need to band together
today is the start of the uprising
but what you need to do is fan the flames of the revolution
you need to go and share your ideas and your success stories of what worked about reinvigorating our lives our schools and our work with play about how play promotes a sense of promise and self-fulfillment of how play promotes innovation and productivity and ultimately how play creates meaning
because we can 't do it alone we have to do it together and together if we do this and share these ideas on play we can transform bulgaria for the better
thank you

radical openness is still a distant future in the field of school education
we have such a hard time figuring out that learning is not a place but an activity
but i want to tell you the story of pisa oecd 's test to measure the knowledge and skills of 15-year-olds around the world and it 's really a story of how international comparisons have globalized the field of education that we usually treat as an affair of domestic policy
look at how the world looked in the 1960s in terms of the proportion of people who had completed high school
you can see the united states ahead of everyone else and much of the economic success of the united states draws on its long-standing advantage as the first mover in education
but in the 1970s some countries caught up
in the 1980s the global expansion of the talent pool continued
and the world didn 't stop in the 1990s
so in the 60s the u.s. was first
in the 90s it was 13th and not because standards had fallen but because they had risen so much faster elsewhere
korea shows you what 's possible in education
two generations ago korea had the standard of living of afghanistan today and was one of the lowest education performers
today every young korean finishes high school
so this tells us that in a global economy it is no longer national improvement that 's the benchmark for success but the best performing education systems internationally
the trouble is that measuring how much time people spend in school or what degree they have got is not always a good way of seeing what they can actually do
look at the toxic mix of unemployed graduates on our streets while employers say they cannot find the people with the skills they need
and that tells you that better degrees don 't automatically translate into better skills and better jobs and better lives
so with pisa we try to change this by measuring the knowledge and skills of people directly
and we took a very special angle to this
we were less interested in whether students can simply reproduce what they have learned in school but we wanted to test whether they can extrapolate from what they know and apply their knowledge in novel situations
now some people have criticized us for this
they say you know such a way of measuring outcomes is terribly unfair to people because we test students with problems they haven 't seen before
but if you take that logic you know you should consider life unfair because the test of truth in life is not whether we can remember what we learned in school but whether we are prepared for change whether we are prepared for jobs that haven 't been created to use technologies that haven 't been invented to solve problems we just can 't anticipate today
and once hotly contested our way of measuring outcomes has actually quickly become the standard
in our latest assessment in 2009 we measured 74 school systems that together cover 87 percent of the economy
this chart shows you the performance of countries
in red sort of below oecd average
yellow is so-so and in green are the countries doing really well
you can see shanghai korea singapore in asia finland in europe canada in north america doing really well
you can also see that there is a gap of almost three and a half school years between 15-year-olds in shanghai and 15-year-olds in chile and the gap grows to seven school years when you include the countries with really poor performance
there 's a world of difference in the way in which young people are prepared for today 's economy
but i want to introduce a second important dimension into this picture
educators like to talk about equity
with pisa we wanted to measure how they actually deliver equity in terms of ensuring that people from different social backgrounds have equal chances
and we see that in some countries the impact of social background on learning outcomes is very very strong
opportunities are unequally distributed
a lot of potential of young children is wasted
we see in other countries that it matters much less into which social context you 're born
we all want to be there in the upper right quadrant where performance is strong and learning opportunities are equally distributed
nobody and no country can afford to be there where performance is poor and there are large social disparities
and then we can debate you know is it better to be there where performance is strong at the price of large disparities
or do we want to focus on equity and accept mediocrity
but actually if you look at how countries come out on this picture you see there are a lot of countries that actually are combining excellence with equity
in fact one of the most important lessons from this comparison is that you don 't have to compromise equity to achieve excellence
these countries have moved on from providing excellence for just some to providing excellence for all a very important lesson
and that also challenges the paradigms of many school systems that believe they are mainly there to sort people
and ever since those results came out policymakers educators researchers from around the world have tried to figure out what 's behind the success of those systems
but let 's step back for a moment and focus on the countries that actually started pisa and i 'm giving them a colored bubble now
and i 'm making the size of the bubble proportional to the amount of money that countries spent on students
if money would tell you everything about the quality of learning outcomes you would find all the large bubbles at the top no
but that 's not what you see
spending per student only explains about well less than 20 percent of the performance variation among countries and luxembourg for example the most expensive system doesn 't do particularly well
what you see is that two countries with similar spending achieve very different results
you also see and i think that 's one of the most encouraging findings that we no longer live in a world that is neatly divided between rich and well-educated countries and poor and badly-educated ones a very very important lesson
let 's look at this in greater detail
the red dot shows you spending per student relative to a country 's wealth
one way you can spend money is by paying teachers well and you can see korea investing a lot in attracting the best people into the teaching profession
and korea also invests into long school days which drives up costs further
last but not least koreans want their teachers not only to teach but also to develop
they invest in professional development and collaboration and many other things
all that costs money
how can korea afford all of this
the answer is students in korea learn in large classes
this is the blue bar which is driving costs down
you go to the next country on the list luxembourg and you can see the red dot is exactly where it is for korea so luxembourg spends the same per student as korea does
but you know parents and teachers and policymakers in luxembourg all like small classes
you know it 's very pleasant to walk into a small class
so they have invested all their money into there and the blue bar class size is driving costs up
but even luxembourg can spend its money only once and the price for this is that teachers are not paid particularly well
students don 't have long hours of learning
and basically teachers have little time to do anything else than teaching
so you can see two countries spent their money very differently and actually how they spent their money matters a lot more than how much they invest in education
let 's go back to the year 2000
remember that was the year before the ipod was invented
this is how the world looked then in terms of pisa performance
the first thing you can see is that the bubbles were a lot smaller no
we spent a lot less on education about 35 percent less on education
so you ask yourself if education has become so much more expensive has it become so much better
and the bitter truth really is that you know not in many countries
but there are some countries which have seen impressive improvements
germany my own country in the year 2000 featured in the lower quadrant below average performance large social disparities
and remember germany we used to be one of those countries that comes out very well when you just count people who have degrees
very disappointing results
people were stunned by the results
and for the very first time the public debate in germany was dominated for months by education not tax not other kinds of issues but education was the center of the public debate
and then policymakers began to respond to this
the federal government dramatically raised its investment in education
a lot was done to increase the life chances of students with an immigrant background or from social disadvantage
and what 's really interesting is that this wasn 't just about optimizing existing policies but data transformed some of the beliefs and paradigms underlying german education
for example traditionally the education of the very young children was seen as the business of families and you would have cases where women were seen as neglecting their family responsibilities when they sent their children to kindergarten
pisa has transformed that debate and pushed early childhood education right at the center of public policy in germany
or traditionally the german education divides children at the age of 10 very young children between those deemed to pursue careers of knowledge workers and those who would end up working for the knowledge workers and that mainly along socioeconomic lines and that paradigm is being challenged now too
a lot of change
and the good news is nine years later you can see improvements in quality and equity
people have taken up the challenge done something about it
or take korea at the other end of the spectrum
in the year 2000 korea did already very well but the koreans were concerned that only a small share of their students achieved the really high levels of excellence
they took up the challenge and korea was able to double the proportion of students achieving excellence in one decade in the field of reading
well if you only focus on your brightest students you know what happens is disparities grow and you can see this bubble moving slightly to the other direction but still an impressive improvement
a major overhaul of poland 's education helped to dramatically reduce between variability among schools turn around many of the lowest-performing schools and raise performance by over half a school year
and you can see other countries as well
portugal was able to consolidate its fragmented school system raise quality and improve equity and so did hungary
so what you can actually see there 's been a lot of change
and even those people who complain and say that the relative standing of countries on something like pisa is just an artifact of culture of economic factors of social issues of homogeneity of societies and so on these people must now concede that education improvement is possible
you know poland hasn 't changed its culture
it didn 't change its economy it didn 't change the compositions of its population
it didn 't fire its teachers it changed its education policies and practice very impressive
and all that raises of course the question what can we learn from those countries in the green quadrant who have achieved high levels of equity high levels of performance and raised outcomes
and of course the question is can what works in one context provide a model elsewhere
of course you can 't copy and paste education systems wholesale but these comparisons have identified a range of factors that high-performing systems share
everybody agrees that education is important
everybody says that
but the test of truth is how do you weigh that priority against other priorities
how do countries pay their teachers relative to other highly skilled workers
would you want your child to become a teacher rather than a lawyer
how do the media talk about schools and teachers
those are the critical questions and what we have learned from pisa is that in high-performing education systems the leaders have convinced their citizens to make choices that value education their future more than consumption today
and you know what 's interesting you won 't believe it but there are countries in which the most attractive place to be is not the shopping center but the school
those things really exist
but placing a high value on education is just part of the picture
the other part is the belief that all children are capable of success
you have some countries where students are segregated early in their ages
you know students are divided up reflecting the belief that only some children can achieve world-class standards
but usually that is linked to very strong social disparities
if you go to japan in asia or finland in europe parents and teachers in those countries expect every student to succeed and you can see that actually mirrored in student behavior
when we asked students what counts for success in mathematics students in north america would typically tell us you know it 's all about talent
if i 'm not born as a genius in math i 'd better study something else
nine out of 10 japanese students say that it depends on my own investment on my own effort and that tells you a lot about the system that is around them
in the past different students were taught in similar ways
high performers on pisa embrace diversity with differentiated pedagogical practices
they realize that ordinary students have extraordinary talents and they personalize learning opportunities
high-performing systems also share clear and ambitious standards across the entire spectrum
every student knows what matters
every student knows what 's required to be successful
and nowhere does the quality of an education system exceed the quality of its teachers
high-performing systems are very careful in how they recruit and select their teachers and how they train them
they watch how they improve the performances of teachers in difficulties who are struggling and how they structure teacher pay
they provide an environment also in which teachers work together to frame good practice
and they provide intelligent pathways for teachers to grow in their careers
in bureaucratic school systems teachers are often left alone in classrooms with a lot of prescription on what they should be teaching
high-performing systems are very clear what good performance is
they set very ambitious standards but then they enable their teachers to figure out what do i need to teach to my students today
the past was about delivered wisdom in education
now the challenge is to enable user-generated wisdom
high performers have moved on from professional or from administrative forms of accountability and control sort of how do you check whether people do what they 're supposed to do in education to professional forms of work organization
they enable their teachers to make innovations in pedagogy
they provide them with the kind of development they need to develop stronger pedagogical practices
the goal of the past was standardization and compliance
high-performing systems have made teachers and school principals inventive
in the past the policy focus was on outcomes on provision
the high-performing systems have helped teachers and school principals to look outwards to the next teacher the next school around their lives
and the most impressive outcomes of world-class systems is that they achieve high performance across the entire system
you 've seen finland doing so well on pisa but what makes finland so impressive is that only five percent of the performance variation amongst students lies between schools
every school succeeds
this is where success is systemic
and how do they do that
they invest resources where they can make the most difference
they attract the strongest principals into the toughest schools and the most talented teachers into the most challenging classroom
last but not least those countries align policies across all areas of public policy
they make them coherent over sustained periods of time and they ensure that what they do is consistently implemented
now knowing what successful systems are doing doesn 't yet tell us how to improve
that 's also clear and that 's where some of the limits of international comparisons of pisa are
that 's where other forms of research need to kick in and that 's also why pisa doesn 't venture into telling countries what they should be doing
but its strength lies in telling them what everybody else has been doing
and the example of pisa shows that data can be more powerful than administrative control of financial subsidy through which we usually run education systems
you know some people argue that changing educational administration is like moving graveyards
you just can 't rely on the people out there to help you with this
but pisa has shown what 's possible in education
it has helped countries to see that improvement is possible
it has taken away excuses from those who are complacent
and it has helped countries to set meaningful targets in terms of measurable goals achieved by the world 's leaders
if we can help every child every teacher every school every principal every parent see what improvement is possible that only the sky is the limit to education improvement we have laid the foundations for better policies and better lives
thank you
i 'd like to talk to you today about the scale of the scientific effort that goes into making the headlines you see in the paper
headlines that look like this when they have to do with climate change and headlines that look like this when they have to do with air quality or smog
they are both two branches of the same field of atmospheric science
recently the headlines looked like this when the intergovernmental panel on climate change or ipcc put out their report on the state of understanding of the atmospheric system
that report was written by 620 scientists from 40 countries
they wrote almost a thousand pages on the topic
and all of those pages were reviewed by another 400-plus scientists and reviewers from 113 countries
it 's a big community it 's such a big community in fact that our annual gathering is the largest scientific meeting in the world
over 15,000 scientists go to san francisco every year for that
and every one of those scientists is in a research group and every research group studies a wide variety of topics
for us at cambridge it 's as varied as the el niño oscillation which affects weather and climate to the assimilation of satellite data to emissions from crops that produce biofuels which is what i happen to study
and in each one of these research areas of which there are even more there are phd students like me and we study incredibly narrow topics things as narrow as a few processes or a few molecules
and one of the molecules i study is called isoprene which is here it 's a small organic molecule you 've probably never heard of it
the weight of a paper clip is approximately equal to 900 zeta-illion 10 to the 21st molecules of isoprene
but despite its very small weight enough of it is emitted into the atmosphere every year to equal the weight of all the people on the planet
it 's a huge amount of stuff it 's equal to the weight of methane
and because it 's so much stuff it 's really important for the atmospheric system
because it 's important to the atmospheric system we go to all lengths to study this thing
we blow it up and look at the pieces
this is the euphore smog chamber in spain
atmospheric explosions or full combustion takes about 15,000 times longer than what happens in your car
but still we look at the pieces
we run enormous models on supercomputers this is what i happen to do
our models have hundreds of thousands of grid boxes calculating hundreds of variables each on minute timescales
and it takes weeks to perform our integrations
and we perform dozens of integrations in order to understand what 's happening
we also fly all over the world looking for this thing
i recently joined a field campaign in malaysia there are others
we found a global atmospheric watchtower there in the middle of the rainforest and hung hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of scientific equipment off this tower to look for isoprene and of course other things while we were there
this is the tower in the middle of the rainforest from above
and this is the tower from below
and on part of that field campaign we even brought an aircraft with us
and this plane the model ba146 which was run by faam normally flies 120 to 130 people
so maybe you took a similar aircraft to get here today
but we didn 't just fly it we were flying at 100 meters above the top of the canopy to measure this molecule incredibly dangerous stuff
we have to fly at a special incline in order to make the measurements
we hire military and test pilots to do the maneuvering
we have to get special flight clearance
and as you come around the banks in these valleys the forces can get up to two gs
and the scientists have to be completely harnessed in in order to make measurements while they 're on board
so as you can imagine the inside of this aircraft doesn 't look like any plane you would take on vacation
it 's a flying laboratory that we took to make measurements in the region of this molecule
we do all of this to understand the chemistry of one molecule
and when one student like me has some sort of inclination or understanding about that molecule they write one scientific paper on the subject
and out of that field campaign we 'll probably get a few dozen papers on a few dozen processes or molecules
and as a body of knowledge builds up it will form one subsection or one sub-subsection of an assessment like the ipcc although we have others
and each one of the 11 chapters of the ipcc has six to ten subsections
so you can imagine the scale of the effort
in each one of those assessments that we write we always tag on a summary and the summary is written for a non-scientific audience
and we hand that summary to journalists and policy makers in order to make headlines like these
thank you very much

hi i 'm going to ask you to raise your arms and wave back just the way i am kind of a royal wave
you can mimic what you can see
you can program the hundreds of muscles in your arm
soon you 'll be able to look inside your brain and program control the hundreds of brain areas that you see there
i 'm going to tell you about that technology
people have wanted to look inside the human mind the human brain for thousands of years
well coming out of the research labs just now for our generation is the possibility to do that
people envision this as being very difficult
you had to take a spaceship shrink it down inject it into the bloodstream
it was terribly dangerous
you could be attacked by white blood cells in the arteries
but now we have a real technology to do this
we 're going to fly into my colleague peter 's brain
we 're going to do it non-invasively using mri
we don 't have to inject anything we don 't need radiation
we will be able to fly into the anatomy of peter 's brain literally fly into his body but more importantly we can look into his mind
when peter moves his arm that yellow spot you see there is the interface to the functioning of peter 's mind taking place
now you 've seen before that with electrodes you can control robotic arms that brain imaging and scanners can show you the insides of brains
what 's new is that that process has typically taken days or months of analysis
we 've collapsed that through technology to milliseconds and that allows us to let peter to look at his brain in real time as he 's inside the scanner
he can look at these 65,000 points of activation per second
if he can see this pattern in his own brain he can learn how to control it
there have been three ways to try to impact the brain the therapist 's couch pills and the knife
this is a fourth alternative that you are soon going to have
we all know that as we form thoughts they form deep channels in our minds and in our brains
chronic pain is an example if you burn yourself you pull your hand away
but if you 're still in pain in six months or six years time it 's because these circuits are producing pain that 's no longer helping you
if we can look at the activation in the brain that 's producing the pain we can form 3d models and watch in real time the brain process information and then we can select the areas that produce the pain
so put your arms back up and flex your bicep
now imagine that you will soon be able to look inside your brain and select brain areas to do that same thing
what you 're seeing here is we 've selected the pathways in the brain of a chronic pain patient
this may shock you but we 're literally reading this person 's brain in real time
they 're watching their own brain activation and they 're controlling the pathway that produces their pain
they 're learning to flex this system that releases their own endogenous opiates
as they do it in the upper left is a display that 's yoked to their brain activation of their own pain being controlled
when they control their brain they can control their pain
this is an investigational technology but in clinical trials we 're seeing a 44 to 64 percent decrease in chronic pain patients
this is not the matrix you can only do this to yourself you take control
i 've seen inside my brain you will too soon
when you do what do you want to control
you will be able to look at all the aspects that make you yourself all your experiences
these are some of the areas we 're working on today that i don 't have time to go into in detail
but i want to leave with you the big question
we are the first generation that 's going to be able to enter into using this technology the human mind and brain
where will we take it
evidence suggests that humans in all ages and from all cultures create their identity in some kind of narrative form
from mother to daughter preacher to congregant teacher to pupil storyteller to audience
whether in cave paintings or the latest uses of the internet human beings have always told their histories and truths through parable and fable
we are inveterate storytellers
but where in our increasingly secular and fragmented world do we offer communality of experience unmediated by our own furious consumerism
and what narrative what history what identity what moral code are we imparting to our young
cinema is arguably the 20th century 's most influential art form
its artists told stories across national boundaries in as many languages genres and philosophies as one can imagine
indeed it is hard to find a subject that film has yet to tackle
during the last decade we 've seen a vast integration of global media now dominated by a culture of the hollywood blockbuster
we are increasingly offered a diet in which sensation not story is king
what was common to us all 40 years ago the telling of stories between generations is now rarified
as a filmmaker it worried me
as a human being it puts the fear of god in me
what future could the young build with so little grasp of where they 've come from and so few narratives of what 's possible
the irony is palpable technical access has never been greater cultural access never weaker
and so in 2006 we set up filmclub an organization that ran weekly film screenings in schools followed by discussions
if we could raid the annals of 100 years of film maybe we could build a narrative that would deliver meaning to the fragmented and restless world of the young
given the access to technology even a school in a tiny rural hamlet could project a dvd onto a white board
in the first nine months we ran 25 clubs across the u.k. with kids in age groups between five and 18 watching a film uninterrupted for 90 minutes
the films were curated and contextualized
but the choice was theirs and our audience quickly grew to choose the richest and most varied diet that we could provide
the outcome immediate
it was an education of the most profound and transformative kind
in groups as large as 150 and as small as three these young people discovered new places new thoughts new perspectives
by the time the pilot had finished we had the names of a thousand schools that wished to join
the film that changed my life is a 1951 film by vittorio de sica miracle in milan
it 's a remarkable comment on slums poverty and aspiration
i had seen the film on the occasion of my father 's 50th birthday
technology then meant we had to hire a viewing cinema find and pay for the print and the projectionist
but for my father the emotional and artistic importance of de sica 's vision was so great that he chose to celebrate his half-century with his three teenage children and 30 of their friends in order he said to pass the baton of concern and hope on to the next generation
in the last shot of miracle in milan slum-dwellers float skyward on flying brooms
sixty years after the film was made and 30 years after i first saw it i see young faces tilt up in awe their incredulity matching mine
and the speed with which they associate it with slumdog millionaire or the favelas in rio speaks to the enduring nature
in a filmclub season about democracy and government we screened mr. smith goes to washington
made in 1939 the film is older than most of our members grandparents
frank capra 's classic values independence and propriety
it shows how to do right how to be heroically awkward
it is also an expression of faith in the political machine as a force of honor
shortly after mr. smith became a filmclub classic there was a week of all-night filibustering in the house of lords
and it was with great delight that we found young people up and down the country explaining with authority what filibustering was and why the lords might defy their bedtime on a point of principle
after all jimmy stewart filibustered for two entire reels
in choosing hotel rwanda they explored genocide of the most brutal kind
it provoked tears as well as incisive questions about unarmed peace-keeping forces and the double-dealing of a western society that picks its moral fights with commodities in mind
and when schindler 's list demanded that they never forget one child full of the pain of consciousness remarked we already forgot otherwise how did hotel rwanda happen
as they watch more films their lives got palpably richer
pickpocket started a debate about criminality disenfranchisement
to sir with love ignited its teen audience
they celebrated a change in attitude towards non-white britons but railed against our restless school system that does not value collective identity unlike that offered by sidney poitier 's careful tutelage
by now these thoughtful opinionated curious young people thought nothing of tackling films of all forms black and white subtitled documentary non-narrative fantasy and thought nothing of writing detailed reviews that competed to favor one film over another in passionate and increasingly sophisticated prose
six thousand reviews each school week vying for the honor of being review of the week
from 25 clubs we became hundreds then thousands until we were nearly a quarter of a million kids in 7,000 clubs right across the country
and although the numbers were and continue to be extraordinary what became more extraordinary was how the experience of critical and curious questioning translated into life
some of our kids started talking with their parents others with their teachers or with their friends
and those without friends started making them
the films provided communality across all manner of divide
and the stories they held provided a shared experience
persepolis brought a daughter closer to her iranian mother and jaws became the way in which one young boy was able to articulate the fear he 'd experienced in flight from violence that killed first his father then his mother the latter thrown overboard on a boat journey
who was right who wrong
what would they do under the same conditions
was the tale told well
was there a hidden message
how has the world changed how could it be different
a tsunami of questions flew out of the mouths of children who the world didn 't think were interested
and they themselves had not known they cared
and as they wrote and debated rather than seeing the films as artifacts they began to see themselves
i have an aunt who is a wonderful storyteller
in a moment she can invoke images of running barefoot on table mountain and playing cops and robbers
quite recently she told me that in 1948 two of her sisters and my father traveled on a boat to israel without my grandparents
when the sailors mutinied at sea in a demand for humane conditions it was these teenagers that fed the crew
i was past 40 when my father died
he never mentioned that journey
my mother 's mother left europe in a hurry without her husband but with her three-year-old daughter and diamonds sewn into the hem of her skirt
after two years in hiding my grandfather appeared in london
he was never right again
and his story was hushed as he assimilated
my story started in england with a clean slate and the silence of immigrant parents
i had anne frank the great escape shoah triumph of the will
it was leni riefenstahl in her elegant nazi propaganda who gave context to what the family had to endure
these films held what was too hurtful to say out loud and they became more useful to me than the whispers of survivors and the occasional glimpse of a tattoo on a maiden aunt 's wrist
purists may feel that fiction dissipates the quest of real human understanding that film is too crude to tell a complex and detailed history or that filmmakers always serve drama over truth
but within the reels lie purpose and meaning
as one 12-year-old said after watching wizard of oz every person should watch this because unless you do you may not know that you too have a heart
we honor reading why not honor watching with the same passion
consider citizen kane as valuable as jane austen
agree that boyz n the hood like tennyson offers an emotional landscape and a heightened understanding that work together
each a piece of memorable art each a brick in the wall of who we are
and it 's okay if we remember tom hanks better than astronaut jim lovell or have ben kingsley 's face superimposed onto that of gandhi 's
and though not real eve harrington howard beale mildred pierce are an opportunity to discover what it is to be human and no less helpful to understanding our life and times as shakespeare is in illuminating the world of elizabethan england
we guessed that film whose stories are a meeting place of drama music literature and human experience would engage and inspire the young people participating in filmclub
what we could not have foreseen was the measurable improvements in behavior confidence and academic achievement
once-reluctant students now race to school talk to their teachers fight not on the playground but to choose next week 's film young people who have found self-definition ambition and an appetite for education and social engagement from the stories they have witnessed
our members defy the binary description of how we so often describe our young
they are neither feral nor myopically self-absorbed
they are like other young people negotiating a world with infinite choice but little culture of how to find meaningful experience
we appeared surprised at the behaviors of those who define themselves by the size of the tick on their shoes yet acquisition has been the narrative we have offered
if we want different values we have to tell a different story a story that understands that an individual narrative is an essential component of a person 's identity that a collective narrative is an essential component of a cultural identity and without it it is impossible to imagine yourself as part of a group
because when these people get home after a screening of rear window and raise their gaze to the building next door they have the tools to wonder who apart from them is out there and what is their story
thank you
it 's a great time to be a molecular biologist
reading and writing dna code is getting easier and cheaper
by the end of this year we 'll be able to sequence the three million bits of information in your genome in less than a day and for less than 1,000 euros
biotech is probably the most powerful and the fastest-growing technology sector
it has the power potentially to replace our fossil fuels to revolutionize medicine and to touch every aspect of our daily lives
so who gets to do it
i think we 'd all be pretty comfortable with this guy doing it
but what about that guy
in 2009 i first heard about diybio
it 's a movement that it advocates making biotechnology accessible to everyone not just scientists and people in government labs
the idea is that if you open up the science and you allow diverse groups to participate it could really stimulate innovation
putting technology in the hands of the end user is usually a good idea because they 've got the best idea of what their needs are
and here 's this really sophisticated technology coming down the road all these associated social moral ethical questions and we scientists are just lousy at explaining to the public just exactly what it is we 're doing in those labs
so wouldn 't it be nice if there was a place in your local neighborhood where you could go and learn about this stuff do it hands-on
i thought so
so three years ago i got together with some friends of mine who had similar aspirations and we founded genspace
it 's a nonprofit a community biotech lab in brooklyn new york and the idea was people could come they could take classes and putter around in the lab in a very open friendly atmosphere
none of my previous experience prepared me for what came next can you guess
the press started calling us
and the more we talked about how great it was to increase science literacy the more they wanted to talk about us creating the next frankenstein and as a result for the next six months when you googled my name instead of getting my scientific papers you got this
[ am i a biohazard ] it was pretty depressing
the only thing that got us through that period was that we knew that all over the world there were other people that were trying to do the same thing that we were
they were opening biohacker spaces and some of them were facing much greater challenges than we did more regulations less resources
but now three years later here 's where we stand
it 's a vibrant global community of hackerspaces and this is just the beginning
these are some of the biggest ones and there are others opening every day
there 's one probably going to open up in moscow one in south korea and the cool thing is they each have their own individual flavor that grew out of the community they came out of
let me take you on a little tour
biohackers work alone
we work in groups in big cities and in small villages
we reverse engineer lab equipment
we genetically engineer bacteria
we hack hardware software wetware and of course the code of life
we like to build things
then we like to take things apart
we make things grow
we make things glow
and we make cells dance
the spirit of these labs it 's open it 's positive but you know sometimes when people think of us the first thing that comes to mind is bio-safety bio-security all the dark side stuff
i 'm not going to minimize those concerns
any powerful technology is inherently dual use and you know you get something like synthetic biology nanobiotechnology it really compels you you have to look at both the amateur groups but also the professional groups because they have better infrastructure they have better facilities and they have access to pathogens
so the united nations did just that and they recently issued a report on this whole area and what they concluded was the power of this technology for positive was much greater than the risk for negative and they even looked specifically at the diybio community and they noted not surprisingly that the press had a tendency to consistently overestimate our capabilities and underestimate our ethics
as a matter of fact diy people from all over the world america europe got together last year and we hammered out a common code of ethics
that 's a lot more than conventional science has done
now we follow state and local regulations
we dispose of our waste properly we follow safety procedures we don 't work with pathogens
you know if you 're working with a pathogen you 're not part of the biohacker community you 're part of the bioterrorist community i 'm sorry
and sometimes people ask me well what about an accident
well working with the safe organisms that we normally work with the chance of an accident happening with somebody accidentally creating like some sort of superbug that 's literally about as probable as a snowstorm in the middle of the sahara desert
now it could happen but i 'm not going to plan my life around it
i 've actually chosen to take a different kind of risk
i signed up for something called the personal genome project
it 's a study at harvard where at the end of the study they 're going to take my entire genomic sequence all of my medical information and my identity and they 're going to post it online for everyone to see
there were a lot of risks involved that they talked about during the informed consent portion
the one i liked the best is someone could download my sequence go back to the lab synthesize some fake ellen dna and plant it at a crime scene
but like diybio the positive outcomes and the potential for good for a study like that far outweighs the risk
now you might be asking yourself well you know what would i do in a biolab
well it wasn 't that long ago we were asking well what would anyone do with a personal computer
so this stuff is just beginning
we 're only seeing just the tip of the dna iceberg
let me show you what you could do right now
a biohacker in germany a journalist wanted to know whose dog was leaving little presents on his street
yep you guessed it he threw tennis balls to all the neighborhood dogs analyzed the saliva identified the dog and confronted the dog owner
i discovered an invasive species in my own backyard
looked like a ladybug right
it actually is a japanese beetle
and the same kind of technology it 's called dna barcoding it 's really cool you can use it to check if your caviar is really beluga if that sushi is really tuna or if that goat cheese that you paid so much for is really goat 's
in a biohacker space you can analyze your genome for mutations
you can analyze your breakfast cereal for gmo 's and you can explore your ancestry
you can send weather balloons up into the stratosphere collect microbes see what 's up there
you can make a biocensor out of yeast to detect pollutants in water
you can make some sort of a biofuel cell
you can do a lot of things
you can also do an art science project some of these are really spectacular and they look at social ecological problems from a completely different perspective
it 's really cool
some people ask me well why am i involved
i could have a perfectly good career in mainstream science
the thing is there 's something in these labs that they have to offer society that you can 't find anywhere else
there 's something sacred about a space where you can work on a project and you don 't have to justify to anyone that it 's going to make a lot of money that it 's going to save mankind or even that it 's feasible
it just has to follow safety guidelines
if you had spaces like this all over the world it could really change the perception of who 's allowed to do biotech
it 's spaces like these that spawned personal computing
why not personal biotech
if everyone in this room got involved who knows what we could do
this is such a new area and as we say back in brooklyn you ain 't seen nothin yet
thank you
thank you very much
that was whistling
i 'm trying to do this in english
what is a chubby curly-haired guy from holland why is he whistling
well actually i 've [ been ] whistling since the age of four about four
my dad was always whistling around the house and i just thought that 's part of communication in my family
so i whistled along with him
and actually till i was 34 i always annoyed and irritated people with whistling because to be honest my whistling is a kind of deviant behavior
i whistled alone i whistled in the classroom
i whistled on [ my ] bike i whistled everywhere
and i also whistled at a christmas eve party with my family-in-law
and they had some in my opinion terrible christmas music
and when i hear music that i don 't like i try to make it better
so rudolph the red-nosed reindeer you know it
but it can also sound like this
but during a christmas party at dinner actually it 's very annoying
so my sister-in-law asked me a few times please stop whistling
and i just couldn 't
and at one point and i had some wine i have to admit that at one point i said if there was a contest i would join
and two weeks later i received a text message you 're going to america
so okay i 'm going to america
i would love to but why
so i immediately called her up of course
she googled and she found this world whistling championship in america of course
she didn 't expect me to go there
and i would have lost my face
i don 't know if that 's correct english
but the dutch people here will understand what i mean
i lost my face
and she thought he will never go there
but actually i did
so i went to louisburg north carolina southeast united states and i entered the world of whistling
and i also entered the world championship and i won there in 2004
that was great fun of course
and to defend my title like judokas do and sportsmen i thought well let 's go back in 2005 and i won again
then i couldn 't participate for a few years
and in 2008 i entered again in japan tokyo and i won again
so what happened now is i 'm standing here in rotterdam in the beautiful city on a big stage and i 'm talking about whistling
and actually i earn my money whistling at the moment
so i quit my day job as a nurse
and i try to live my dream well actually it was never my dream but it sounds so good
okay i 'm not the only one whistling here
you say huh what do you mean
well actually you are going to whistle along
and then always the same thing happens people are watching each other and think oh my god
why can i go away
no you can 't
actually it 's very simple
the track that i will whistle is called fête de la belle
it 's about 80 minutes long
no no no it 's four minutes long
and i want to first rehearse with you your whistling
so i whistle the tone
sorry i forgot one thing
you whistle the same tone as me
i heard a wide variety of tones
this is very promising
this is very promising
i 'll ask the technicians to start the music
and if it 's started i just point where you whistle along and we will see what happens
oh hah
i 'm so sorry technicians
i 'm so used to that
i start it myself
okay here it is
okay
it 's easy isn 't it
now comes the solo i propose i do that myself
max westerman geert chatrou the world champion [ of ] whistling
geert chatrou thank you thank you
i 'm here to show you how something you can 't see can be so much fun to look at
you 're about to experience a new available and exciting technology that 's going to make us rethink how we waterproof our lives
what i have here is a cinder block that we 've coated half with a nanotechnology spray that can be applied to almost any material
it 's called ultra-ever dry and when you apply it to any material it turns into a superhydrophobic shield
so this is a cinder block uncoated and you can see that it 's porous it absorbs water
not anymore
porous nonporous
so what 's superhydrophobic
superhydrophobic is how we measure a drop of water on a surface
the rounder it is the more hydrophobic it is and if it 's really round it 's superhydrophobic
a freshly waxed car the water molecules slump to about 90 degrees
a windshield coating is going to give you about 110 degrees
but what you 're seeing here is 160 to 175 degrees and anything over 150 is superhydrophobic
so as part of the demonstration what i have is a pair of gloves and we 've coated one of the gloves with the nanotechnology coating and let 's see if you can tell which one and i 'll give you a hint
did you guess the one that was dry
when you have nanotechnology and nanoscience what 's occurred is that we 're able to now look at atoms and molecules and actually control them for great benefits
and we 're talking really small here
the way you measure nanotechnology is in nanometers and one nanometer is a billionth of a meter and to put some scale to that if you had a nanoparticle that was one nanometer thick and you put it side by side and you had 50,000 of them you 'd be the width of a human hair
so very small but very useful
and it 's not just water that this works with
it 's a lot of water-based materials like concrete water-based paint mud and also some refined oils as well
you can see the difference
moving onto the next demonstration we 've taken a pane of glass and we 've coated the outside of it we 've framed it with the nanotechnology coating and we 're going to pour this green-tinted water inside the middle and you 're going to see it 's going to spread out on glass like you 'd normally think it would except when it hits the coating it stops and i can 't even coax it to leave
it 's that afraid of the water
so what 's going on here what 's happening
well the surface of the spray coating is actually filled with nanoparticles that form a very rough and craggly surface
you 'd think it 'd be smooth but it 's actually not
and it has billions of interstitial spaces and those spaces along with the nanoparticles reach up and grab the air molecules and cover the surface with air
it 's an umbrella of air all across it and that layer of air is what the water hits the mud hits the concrete hits and it glides right off
so if i put this inside this water here you can see a silver reflective coating around it and that silver reflective coating is the layer of air that 's protecting the water from touching the paddle and it 's dry
so what are the applications
i mean many of you right now are probably going through your head
everyone that sees this gets excited and says oh i could use it for this and this and this
the applications in a general sense could be anything that 's anti-wetting
we 've certainly seen that today
it could be anything that 's anti-icing because if you don 't have water you don 't have ice
it could be anti-corrosion
no water no corrosion
it could be anti-bacterial
without water the bacteria won 't survive
and it could be things that need to be self-cleaning as well
so imagine how something like this could help revolutionize your field of work
and i 'm going to leave you with one last demonstration but before i do that i would like to say thank you and think small
it 's going to happen wait for it wait for it
you guys didn 't hear about us cutting out the design from ted
[ two minutes later ... ] he ran into all sorts of problems in terms of managing the medical research part
it 's happening
i want to talk to you today a little bit about predictable irrationality
and my interest in irrational behavior started many years ago in the hospital
i was burned very badly
and if you spend a lot of time in hospital you 'll see a lot of types of irrationalities
and the one that particularly bothered me in the burn department was the process by which the nurses took the bandage off me
now you must have all taken a band-aid off at some point and you must have wondered what 's the right approach
do you rip it off quickly short duration but high intensity or do you take your band-aid off slowly you take a long time but each second is not as painful which one of those is the right approach
the nurses in my department thought that the right approach was the ripping one so they would grab hold and they would rip and they would grab hold and they would rip
and because i had 70 percent of my body burned it would take about an hour
and as you can imagine i hated that moment of ripping with incredible intensity
and i would try to reason with them and say why don 't we try something else
why don 't we take it a little longer maybe two hours instead of an hour and have less of this intensity
and the nurses told me two things
they told me that they had the right model of the patient that they knew what was the right thing to do to minimize my pain and they also told me that the word patient doesn 't mean to make suggestions or to interfere or ...
this is not just in hebrew by the way
it 's in every language i 've had experience with so far
and you know there 's not much there wasn 't much i could do and they kept on doing what they were doing
and about three years later when i left the hospital i started studying at the university
and one of the most interesting lessons i learned was that there is an experimental method that if you have a question you can create a replica of this question in some abstract way and you can try to examine this question maybe learn something about the world
so that 's what i did
i was still interested in this question of how do you take bandages off burn patients
so originally i didn 't have much money so i went to a hardware store and i bought a carpenter 's vice
and i would bring people to the lab and i would put their finger in it and i would crunch it a little bit
and i would crunch it for long periods and short periods and pain that went up and pain that went down and with breaks and without breaks all kinds of versions of pain
and when i finished hurting people a little bit i would ask them so how painful was this or how painful was this
or if you had to choose between the last two which one would you choose
i kept on doing this for a while
and then like all good academic projects i got more funding
i moved to sounds electrical shocks i even had a pain suit that i could get people to feel much more pain
but at the end of this process what i learned was that the nurses were wrong
here were wonderful people with good intentions and plenty of experience and nevertheless they were getting things wrong predictably all the time
it turns out that because we don 't encode duration in the way that we encode intensity i would have had less pain if the duration would have been longer and the intensity was lower
it turns out it would have been better to start with my face which was much more painful and move toward my legs giving me a trend of improvement over time that would have been also less painful
and it also turns out that it would have been good to give me breaks in the middle to kind of recuperate from the pain
all of these would have been great things to do and my nurses had no idea
and from that point on i started thinking are the nurses the only people in the world who get things wrong in this particular decision or is it a more general case
and it turns out it 's a more general case there 's a lot of mistakes we do
and i want to give you one example of one of these irrationalities and i want to talk to you about cheating
and the reason i picked cheating is because it 's interesting but also it tells us something i think about the stock market situation we 're in
so my interest in cheating started when enron came on the scene exploded all of a sudden and i started thinking about what is happening here
is it the case that there was kind of a few apples who are capable of doing these things or are we talking a more endemic situation that many people are actually capable of behaving this way
so like we usually do i decided to do a simple experiment
and here 's how it went
if you were in the experiment i would pass you a sheet of paper with 20 simple math problems that everybody could solve but i wouldn 't give you enough time
when the five minutes were over i would say pass me the sheets of paper and i 'll pay you a dollar per question
people did this i would pay people four dollars for their task on average people would solve four problems
other people i would tempt to cheat
i would pass their sheet of paper
when the five minutes were over i would say please shred the piece of paper
put the little pieces in your pocket or in your backpack and tell me how many questions you got correctly
people now solved seven questions on average
now it wasn 't as if there was a few bad apples a few people cheated a lot
instead what we saw is a lot of people who cheat a little bit
now in economic theory cheating is a very simple cost-benefit analysis
you say what 's the probability of being caught
how much do i stand to gain from cheating
and how much punishment would i get if i get caught
and you weigh these options out you do the simple cost-benefit analysis and you decide whether it 's worthwhile to commit the crime or not
so we try to test this
for some people we varied how much money they could get away with how much money they could steal
we paid them 10 cents per correct question 50 cents a dollar five dollars 10 dollars per correct question
you would expect that as the amount of money on the table increases people would cheat more but in fact it wasn 't the case
we got a lot of people cheating by stealing by a little bit
what about the probability of being caught
some people shredded half the sheet of paper so there was some evidence left
some people shredded the whole sheet of paper
some people shredded everything went out of the room and paid themselves from the bowl of money that had over 100 dollars
you would expect that as the probability of being caught goes down people would cheat more but again this was not the case
again a lot of people cheated by just by a little bit and they were insensitive to these economic incentives
so we said if people are not sensitive to the economic rational theory explanations to these forces what could be going on
and we thought maybe what is happening is that there are two forces
at one hand we all want to look at ourselves in the mirror and feel good about ourselves so we don 't want to cheat
on the other hand we can cheat a little bit and still feel good about ourselves
so maybe what is happening is that there 's a level of cheating we can 't go over but we can still benefit from cheating at a low degree as long as it doesn 't change our impressions about ourselves
we call this like a personal fudge factor
now how would you test a personal fudge factor
initially we said what can we do to shrink the fudge factor
so we got people to the lab and we said we have two tasks for you today
first we asked half the people to recall either 10 books they read in high school or to recall the ten commandments and then we tempted them with cheating
turns out the people who tried to recall the ten commandments and in our sample nobody could recall all of the ten commandments but those people who tried to recall the ten commandments given the opportunity to cheat did not cheat at all
it wasn 't that the more religious people the people who remembered more of the commandments cheated less and the less religious people the people who couldn 't remember almost any commandments cheated more
the moment people thought about trying to recall the ten commandments they stopped cheating
in fact even when we gave self-declared atheists the task of swearing on the bible and we give them a chance to cheat they don 't cheat at all
now ten commandments is something that is hard to bring into the education system so we said why don 't we get people to sign the honor code
so we got people to sign i understand that this short survey falls under the mit honor code
then they shredded it no cheating whatsoever
and this is particularly interesting because mit doesn 't have an honor code
so all this was about decreasing the fudge factor
what about increasing the fudge factor
the first experiment i walked around mit and i distributed six-packs of cokes in the refrigerators these were common refrigerators for the undergrads
and i came back to measure what we technically call the half-lifetime of coke how long does it last in the refrigerators
as you can expect it doesn 't last very long people take it
in contrast i took a plate with six one-dollar bills and i left those plates in the same refrigerators
no bill ever disappeared
now this is not a good social science experiment so to do it better i did the same experiment as i described to you before
a third of the people we passed the sheet they gave it back to us
a third of the people we passed it to they shredded it they came to us and said mr. experimenter i solved x problems give me x dollars
a third of the people when they finished shredding the piece of paper they came to us and said mr experimenter i solved x problems give me x tokens
we did not pay them with dollars we paid them with something else
and then they took the something else they walked 12 feet to the side and exchanged it for dollars
think about the following intuition
how bad would you feel about taking a pencil from work home compared to how bad would you feel about taking 10 cents from a petty cash box
these things feel very differently
would being a step removed from cash for a few seconds by being paid by token make a difference
our subjects doubled their cheating
i 'll tell you what i think about this and the stock market in a minute
but this did not solve the big problem i had with enron yet because in enron there 's also a social element
people see each other behaving
in fact every day when we open the news we see examples of people cheating
what does this cause us
so we did another experiment
we got a big group of students to be in the experiment and we prepaid them
so everybody got an envelope with all the money for the experiment and we told them that at the end we asked them to pay us back the money they didn 't make ok
the same thing happens
when we give people the opportunity to cheat they cheat
they cheat just by a little bit all the same
but in this experiment we also hired an acting student
this acting student stood up after 30 seconds and said i solved everything what do i do now
and the experimenter said if you 've finished everything go home
that 's it the task is finished
so now we had a student an acting student that was a part of the group
nobody knew it was an actor
and they clearly cheated in a very very serious way
what would happen to the other people in the group
will they cheat more or will they cheat less
here is what happens
it turns out it depends on what kind of sweatshirt they 're wearing
here is the thing
we ran this at carnegie mellon and pittsburgh
and at pittsburgh there are two big universities carnegie mellon and university of pittsburgh
all of the subjects sitting in the experiment were carnegie mellon students
when the actor who was getting up was a carnegie mellon student he was actually a carnegie mellon student but he was a part of their group cheating went up
but when he actually had a university of pittsburgh sweatshirt cheating went down
now this is important because remember when the moment the student stood up it made it clear to everybody that they could get away with cheating because the experimenter said you 've finished everything go home and they went with the money
so it wasn 't so much about the probability of being caught again
it was about the norms for cheating
if somebody from our in-group cheats and we see them cheating we feel it 's more appropriate as a group to behave this way
but if it 's somebody from another group these terrible people i mean not terrible in this but somebody we don 't want to associate ourselves with from another university another group all of a sudden people 's awareness of honesty goes up a little bit like the ten commandments experiment and people cheat even less
so what have we learned from this about cheating
we 've learned that a lot of people can cheat
they cheat just by a little bit
when we remind people about their morality they cheat less
when we get bigger distance from cheating from the object of money for example people cheat more
and when we see cheating around us particularly if it 's a part of our in-group cheating goes up
now if we think about this in terms of the stock market think about what happens
what happens in a situation when you create something where you pay people a lot of money to see reality in a slightly distorted way
would they not be able to see it this way
of course they would
what happens when you do other things like you remove things from money
you call them stock or stock options derivatives mortgage-backed securities
could it be that with those more distant things it 's not a token for one second it 's something that is many steps removed from money for a much longer time could it be that people will cheat even more
and what happens to the social environment when people see other people behave around them
i think all of those forces worked in a very bad way in the stock market
more generally i want to tell you something about behavioral economics
we have many intuitions in our life and the point is that many of these intuitions are wrong
the question is are we going to test those intuitions
we can think about how we 're going to test this intuition in our private life in our business life and most particularly when it goes to policy when we think about things like no child left behind when you create new stock markets when you create other policies taxation health care and so on
and the difficulty of testing our intuition was the big lesson i learned when i went back to the nurses to talk to them
so i went back to talk to them and tell them what i found out about removing bandages
and i learned two interesting things
one was that my favorite nurse ettie told me that i did not take her pain into consideration
she said of course you know it was very painful for you
but think about me as a nurse taking removing the bandages of somebody i liked and had to do it repeatedly over a long period of time
creating so much torture was not something that was good for me too
and she said maybe part of the reason was it was difficult for her
but it was actually more interesting than that because she said i did not think that your intuition was right
i felt my intuition was correct
so if you think about all of your intuitions it 's very hard to believe that your intuition is wrong
and she said given the fact that i thought my intuition was right ... she thought her intuition was right it was very difficult for her to accept doing a difficult experiment to try and check whether she was wrong
but in fact this is the situation we 're all in all the time
we have very strong intuitions about all kinds of things our own ability how the economy works how we should pay school teachers
but unless we start testing those intuitions we 're not going to do better
and just think about how better my life would have been if these nurses would have been willing to check their intuition and how everything would have been better if we just start doing more systematic experimentation of our intuitions
thank you very much
in this talk today i want to present a different idea for why investing in early childhood education makes sense as a public investment
it 's a different idea because usually when people talk about early childhood programs they talk about all the wonderful benefits for participants in terms of former participants in preschool they have better k-12 test scores better adult earnings
now that 's all very important but what i want to talk about is what preschool does for state economies and for promoting state economic development
and that 's actually crucial because if we 're going to get increased investment in early childhood programs we need to interest state governments in this
the federal government has a lot on its plate and state governments are going to have to step up
so we have to appeal to them the legislators in the state government and turn to something they understand that they have to promote the economic development of their state economy
now by promoting economic development i don 't mean anything magical
all i mean is is that early childhood education can bring more and better jobs to a state and can thereby promote higher per capita earnings for the state 's residents
now i think it 's fair to say that when people think about state and local economic development they don 't generally think first about what they 're doing about childcare and early childhood programs
i know this i 've spent most of my career researching these programs
i 've talked to a lot of directors of state economic development agencies about these issues a lot of legislators about these issues
when legislators and others think about economic development what they first of all think about are business tax incentives property tax abatements job creation tax credits you know there are a million of these programs all over the place
so for example states compete very vigorously to attract new auto plants or expanded auto plants
they hand out all kinds of business tax breaks
now those programs can make sense if they in fact induce new location decisions and the way they can make sense is by creating more and better jobs they raise employment rates raise per capita earnings of state residents
so there is a benefit to state residents that corresponds to the costs that they 're paying by paying for these business tax breaks
my argument is essentially that early childhood programs can do exactly the same thing create more and better jobs but in a different way
it 's a somewhat more indirect way
these programs can promote more and better jobs by you build it you invest in high-quality preschool it develops the skills of your local workforce if enough of them stick around and in turn that higher-quality local workforce will be a key driver of creating jobs and creating higher earnings per capita in the local community
now let me turn to some numbers on this
okay if you look at the research evidence that 's extensive on how much early childhood programs affect the educational attainment wages and skills of former participants in preschool as adults you take those known effects you take how many of those folks will be expected to stick around the state or local economy and not move out and you take research on how much skills drive job creation you will conclude from these three separate lines of research that for every dollar invested in early childhood programs the per capita earnings of state residents go up by two dollars and 78 cents so that 's a three-to-one return
now you can get much higher returns of up to 16-to-one if you include anti-crime benefits if you include benefits to former preschool participants who move to some other state but there 's a good reason for focusing on these three dollars because this is salient and important to state legislators and state policy makers and it 's the states that are going to have to act
so there is this key benefit that is relevant to state policy makers in terms of economic development
now one objection you often hear or maybe you don 't hear it because people are too polite to say it is why should i pay more taxes to invest in other people 's children
what 's in it for me
and the trouble with that objection it reflects a total misunderstanding of how much local economies involve everyone being interdependent
specifically the interdependency here is is that there are huge spillovers of skills that when other people 's children get more skills that actually increases the prosperity of everyone including people whose skills don 't change
so for example numerous research studies have shown if you look at what really drives the growth rate of metropolitan areas it 's not so much low taxes low cost low wages it 's the skills of the area particularly the proxy for skills that people use is percentage of college graduates in the area
so when you look for example at metropolitan areas such as the boston area minneapolis-st paul silicon valley these areas are not doing well economically because they 're low-cost
i don 't know if you ever tried to buy a house in silicon valley
it 's not exactly a low-cost proposition
they are growing because they have high levels of skills
so when we invest in other people 's children and build up those skills we increase the overall job growth of a metro area
as another example if we look at what determines an individual 's wages and we do statistical exploration of that what determines wages we know that the individual 's wages will depend in part on that individual 's education for example whether or not they have a college degree
one of the very interesting facts is that in addition we find that even once we hold constant statistically the effect of your own education the education of everyone else in your metropolitan area also affects your wages
so specifically if you hold constant your education you stick in percentage of college graduates in your metro area you will find that has a significant positive effect on your wages without changing your education at all
in fact this effect is so strong that when someone gets a college degree the spillover effects of this on the wages of others in the metropolitan area are actually greater than the direct effects
so if someone gets a college degree their lifetime earnings go up by a huge amount over 700,000 dollars
there 's an effect on everyone else in the metro area of driving up the percentage of college graduates in the metro area and if you add that up it 's a small effect for each person but if you add that up across all the people in the metro area you actually get that the increase in wages for everyone else in the metropolitan area adds up to almost a million dollars
that 's actually greater than the direct benefits of the person choosing to get education
now what 's going on here
what can explain these huge spillover effects of education
well let 's think about it this way
i can be the most skilled person in the world but if everyone else at my firm lacks skills my employer is going to find it more difficult to introduce new technology new production techniques
so as a result my employer is going to be less productive
they will not be able to afford to pay me as good wages
even if everyone at my firm has good skills if the workers at the suppliers to my firm do not have good skills my firm is going to be less competitive competing in national and international markets
and again the firm that 's less competitive will not be able to pay as good wages and then particularly in high-tech businesses they 're constantly stealing ideas and workers from other businesses
so clearly the productivity of firms in silicon valley has a lot to do with the skills not only of the workers at their firm but the workers at all the other firms in the metro area
so as a result if we can invest in other people 's children through preschool and other early childhood programs that are high-quality we not only help those children we help everyone in the metropolitan area gain in wages and we 'll have the metropolitan area gain in job growth
another objection used sometimes here to invest in early childhood programs is concern about people moving out
so you know maybe ohio 's thinking about investing in more preschool education for children in columbus ohio but they 're worried that these little buckeyes will for some strange reason decide to move to ann arbor michigan and become wolverines
and maybe michigan will be thinking about investing in preschool in ann arbor michigan and be worried these little wolverines will end up moving to ohio and becoming buckeyes
and so they 'll both underinvest because everyone 's going to move out
well the reality is if you look at the data americans aren 't as hyper-mobile as people sometimes assume
the data is that over 60 percent of americans spend most of their working careers in the state they were born in over 60 percent
that percentage does not vary much from state to state
it doesn 't vary much with the state 's economy whether it 's depressed or booming it doesn 't vary much over time
so the reality is if you invest in kids they will stay
or at least enough of them will stay that it will pay off for your state economy
okay so to sum up there is a lot of research evidence that early childhood programs if run in a high-quality way pay off in higher adult skills
there 's a lot of research evidence that those folks will stick around the state economy and there 's a lot of evidence that having more workers with higher skills in your local economy pays off in higher wages and job growth for your local economy and if you calculate the numbers for each dollar we get about three dollars back in benefits for the state economy
so in my opinion the research evidence is compelling and the logic of this is compelling
so what are the barriers to getting it done
well one obvious barrier is cost
so if you look at what it would cost if every state government invested in universal preschool at age four full-day preschool at age four the total annual national cost would be roughly 30 billion dollars
so 30 billion dollars is a lot of money
on the other hand if you reflect on that the u.s. s population is over 300 million we 're talking about an amount of money that amounts to 100 dollars per capita
okay a hundred dollars per capita per person is something that any state government can afford to do
it 's just a simple matter of political will to do it
and of course as i mentioned this cost has corresponding benefits
i mentioned there 's a multiplier of about three 2.78 for the state economy in terms of over 80 billion in extra earnings
and if we want to translate that from just billions of dollars to something that might mean something what we 're talking about is that for the average low-income kid that would increase earnings by about 10 percent over their whole career just doing the preschool not improving k-12 or anything else after that not doing anything with college tuition or access just directly improving preschool and we would get five percent higher earnings for middle-class kids
so this is an investment that pays off in very concrete terms for a broad range of income groups in the state 's population and produces large and tangible benefits
now that 's one barrier
i actually think the more profound barrier is the long-term nature of the benefits from early childhood programs
so the argument i 'm making is is that we 're increasing the quality of our local workforce and thereby increasing economic development
obviously if we have a preschool with four-year-olds we 're not sending these kids out at age five to work in the sweatshops right at least i hope not
so we 're talking about an investment that in terms of impacts on the state economy is not going to really pay off for 15 or 20 years and of course america is notorious for being a short term-oriented society
now one response you can make to this and i sometimes have done this in talks is people can talk about there are benefits for these programs in reducing special ed and remedial education costs there are benefits parents care about preschool maybe we 'll get some migration effects from parents seeking good preschool and i think those are true but in some sense they 're missing the point
ultimately this is something we 're investing in now for the future
and so what i want to leave you with is what i think is the ultimate question
i mean i 'm an economist but this is ultimately not an economic question it 's a moral question are we willing as americans are we as a society still capable of making the political choice to sacrifice now by paying more taxes in order to improve the long-term future of not only our kids but our community
are we still capable of that as a country
and that 's something that each and every citizen and voter needs to ask themselves
is that something that you are still invested in that you still believe in the notion of investment
that is the notion of investment
you sacrifice now for a return later
so i think the research evidence on the benefits of early childhood programs for the local economy is extremely strong
however the moral and political choice is still up to us as citizens and as voters
thank you very much
the first idea i 'd like to suggest is that we all love music a great deal it means a lot to us
but music is even more powerful if you don 't just listen to it but you make it yourself
so that 's my first idea and we all know about the mozart effect the idea that 's been around for the last five to 10 years that just by listening to music or by playing music to your baby [ in utero ] that it 'll raise our iq points 10 20 30 percent
great idea but it doesn 't work at all
so you can 't just listen to music you have to make it somehow
and i 'd add to that that it 's not just making it but everybody each of us everybody in the world has the power to create and be part of music in a very dynamic way and that 's one of the main parts of my work
so with the mit media lab for quite a while now we 've been engaged in a field called active music
what are all the possible ways that we can think of to get everybody in the middle of a musical experience not just listening but making music
and we started by making instruments for some of the world 's greatest performers we call these hyperinstruments for yo-yo ma peter gabriel prince orchestras rock bands instruments where they 're all kinds of sensors built right into the instrument so the instrument knows how it 's being played
and just by changing the interpretation and the feeling i can turn my cello into a voice or into a whole orchestra or into something that nobody has ever heard before
when we started making these i started thinking why can 't we make wonderful instruments like that for everybody people who aren 't fantastic yo-yo mas or princes
so we 've made a whole series of instruments
one of the largest collections is called the brain opera
it 's a whole orchestra of about 100 instruments all designed for anybody to play using natural skill
so you can play a video game drive through a piece of music use your body gesture to control huge masses of sound touch a special surface to make melodies use your voice to make a whole aura
and when we make the brain opera we invite the public to come in to try these instruments and then collaborate with us to help make each performance of the brain opera
we toured that for a long time it is now permanently in vienna where we built a museum around it
and that led to something which you probably do know
guitar hero came out of our lab and my two teenage daughters and most of the students at the mit media lab are proof that if you make the right kind of interface people are really interested in being in the middle of a piece of music and playing it over and over and over again
so the model works but it 's only the tip of the iceberg because my second idea is that it 's not enough just to want to make music in something like guitar hero
and music is very fun but it 's also transformative
it 's very very important
music can change your life more than almost anything
it can change the way you communicate with others it can change your body it can change your mind so we 're trying to go to the next step of how you build on top of something like guitar hero
we are very involved in education we have a long-term project called toy symphony where we make all kinds of instruments that are also addictive but for little kids so the kids will fall in love with making music want to spend their time doing it and then will demand to know how it works how to make more how to create so we make squeezy instruments like these music shapers that measure the electricity in your fingers beatbugs that let you tap in rhythms they gather your rhythm and like hot potato you send your rhythm to your friends who then have to imitate or respond to what your doing and a software package called hyperscore which lets anybody use lines and color to make quite sophisticated music extremely easy to use but once you use it you can go quite deep music in any style and then by pressing a button it turns into music notation so that live musicians can play your pieces
we 've had good enough really very powerful effects with kids around the world and now people of all ages using hyperscore
so we 've gotten more and more interested in using these kinds of creative activities in a much broader context for all kinds of people who don 't usually have the opportunity to make music
so one of the growing fields that we 're working on at the media lab right now is music mind and health
a lot of you have probably seen oliver sacks wonderful new book called musicophilia it 's on sale in the bookstore it 's a great book
if you haven 't seen it it 's worth reading he 's a pianist himself and he details his whole career of looking at and observing incredibly powerful effects that music has had on peoples lives in unusual situations
so we know for instance that music is almost always the last thing that people with advanced alzheimer 's can still respond to
maybe many of you have noticed this with loved ones you can find somebody who can 't recognize their face in the mirror or can 't tell anyone in their family but you can still find a shard of music that that person will jump out of the chair and start singing and with that you can bring back parts of people 's memories and personalities
music is the best way to restore speech to people who have lost it through strokes movement to people with parkinson 's disease
it 's very powerful for depression schizophrenia many many things
so we 're working on understanding those underlying principles and then building activities which will let music really improve people 's health
and we do this in many ways we work with many different hospitals
one of them is right near boston called tewksbury hospital
it 's a long-term state hospital where several years ago we started working with hyperscore and patients with physical and mental disabilities
this has become a central part of the treatment at tewksbury hospital so everybody there clamors to work on musical activities
it 's the activity that seems to accelerate people 's treatment the most and it also brings the entire hospital together as a kind of musical community
i wanted to show you a quick video of some of this work before i go on
they 're manipulating each other 's rhythms
it 's a real experience not only to learn how to play and listen to rhythms but to train your musical memory and playing music in a group
to get their hands on music to shape it themselves change it to experiment with it to make their own music
so hyperscore lets you start from scratch very quickly
everybody can experience music in a profound way we just have to make different tools
the third idea i want to share with you is that music paradoxically i think even more than words is one of the very best ways we have of showing who we really are i love giving talks although strangely i feel more nervous giving talks than playing music
if i were here playing cello or playing on a synth or sharing my music with you i 'd be able to show things about myself that i can 't tell you in words more personal things perhaps deeper things
i think that 's true for many of us and i want to give you two examples of how music is one of the most powerful interfaces we have from ourselves to the outside world
the first is a really crazy project that we 're building right now called death and the powers and it 's a big opera one of the larger opera projects going on in the world right now
and it 's about a man rich successful powerful who wants to live forever
so he figures out a way to download himself into his environment actually into a series of books
so this guy wants to live forever he downloads himself into his environment
the main singer disappears at the beginning of the opera and the entire stage becomes the main character it becomes his legacy
and the opera is about what we can share what we can pass on to others to the people we love and what we can 't
every object in the opera comes alive and is a gigantic music instrument like this chandelier it takes up the whole stage it looks like a chandelier but it 's actually a robotic music instrument
so as you can see in this prototype gigantic piano strings each string is controlled with a little robotic element either little bows that stroke the strings propellers that tickle the strings acoustic signals that vibrate the strings we also have an army of robots on stage
these robots are the kind of the intermediary between the main character simon powers and his family there are a whole series of them kind of like a greek chorus
they observe the action we 've designed these square robots that we 're testing right now at mit called operabots these operabots follow my music
they follow the characters they 're smart enough we hope not to bump into each other they go off on their own
and then they can also when you snap line up exactly the way you 'd like to
even though they 're cubes they actually have a lot of personality
the largest set piece in the opera is called the system it 's a series of books
every single book is robotic so they all move they all make sound and when you put them all together they turn into these walls which have the gesture and the personality of simon powers so he 's disappeared but the whole physical environment becomes this person
this is how he 's chosen to represent himself
the books also have high-packed leds on the spines so it 's all display
and here 's the great baritone james maddalena as he enters the system
this is a sneak preview
this premieres in monaco it 's in september 2009 if by any chance you can 't make it another idea with this project here 's this guy building his legacy through this very unusual form through music and through the environment
but we 're also making this available both online and in public spaces as a way of each of us to use music and images from our lives to make our own legacy or to make a legacy of someone we love
so instead of being grand opera this opera will turn into what we 're thinking of as personal opera
and if you 're going to make a personal opera what about a personal instrument
everything i 've shown you so far whether it 's a hyper-cello for yo-yo ma or squeezy toy for a child the instruments stayed the same and are valuable for a certain class of person a virtuoso a child
but what if i could make an instrument that could be adapted to the way i personally behave to the way my hands work to what i do very skillfully perhaps to what i don 't do so skillfully
i think that this is the future of interface it 's the future of music the future of instruments
and i 'd like now to invite two very special people on the stage so that i can give you an example of what personal instruments might be like
so can you give a hand to adam boulanger ph.d. student from the mit media lab and dan ellsey dan thanks to ted and to bombardier flexjet dan is here with us today all the way from tewksbury he 's a resident at tewksbury hospital
this is by far the farthest he 's strayed from tewksbury hospital i can tell you that because he 's motivated to meet with you today and show you his own music
so first of all dan do you want to say hi to everyone and tell everyone who you are
dan ellsey hello my name is dan ellsey i am 34 years old and i have cerebral palsy
i have always loved music and i am excited to be able to conduct my own music with this new software
tod machover and we 're really excited to have you here really dan
so we met dan about three years ago three and a half years ago when we started working at tewksbury everybody we met there was fantastic did fantastic music dan had never made music before and it turned out he was really fantastic at it he 's a born composer
he 's very shy too
so turned out he 's a fantastic composer and over the last few years has been a constant collaborator of ours he has made many many pieces
he makes his own cds actually he is quite well known in the boston area mentors people at the hospital and children locally in how to make their own music
and i 'll let adam tell you so adam is a ph.d. student at mit an expert in music technology and medicine and adam and dan have become close collaborators
what adam 's been working on for this last period is not only how to have dan be able easily to make his own pieces but how he can perform his piece using this kind of personal instrument
so you want to say a little bit about how you guys work
adam boulanger yes so tod and i entered into a discussion following the tewksbury work and it was really about how dan is an expressive person and he 's an intelligent and creative person and it 's in his face it 's in his breathing it 's in his eyes how come he can 't perform one of his pieces of music that 's our responsibility and it doesn 't make sense
so we started developing a technology that will allow him with nuance with precision with control and despite his physical disability to be able to do that to be able to perform his piece of music
so the process and the technology basically first we needed an engineering solution so you know we have a firewire camera it looked at an infrared pointer
we went with the type of gesture metaphor that dan was already used to with his speaking controller
and this was actually the least interesting part of the work you know the design process we needed an input we needed continuous tracking in the software we look at the types of shapes he 's making
but then was the really interesting aspect of the work following the engineering part where basically we 're coding over dan 's shoulder at the hospital extensively to figure out you know how does dan move
what 's useful to him as an expressive motion
you know what 's his metaphor for performance
what types of things does he find important to control and convey in a piece of music
so all the parameter fitting and really the technology was stretched at that point to fit just dan
and you know i think this is a perspective shift it 's not that our technologies they provide access they allow us to create pieces of creative work
but what about expression what about that moment when an artist delivers that piece of work you know do our technologies allow us to express
do they provide structure for us to do that and you know that 's a personal relationship to expression that is lacking in the technological sphere so you know with dan we needed a new design process a new engineering process to sort of discover his movement and his path to expression that allow him to perform
and so that 's what we 'll do today
tm so let 's do it so dan do you want to tell everyone about what you 're going to play now
de this is my eagle song
tm so dan is going to play a piece of his called my eagle song
in fact this is the score for dan 's piece completely composed by dan in hyperscore
so he can use his infrared tracker to go directly into hyperscore
he 's incredibly fast at it too faster than i am in fact
tm he 's really modest too
so he can go in hyperscore you start out by making melodies and rhythms
he can place those exactly where he wants
each one gets a color he goes back into the composition window draws the lines places everything the way he wants to looking at the hyperscore you can see it also you can see where the sections are something might continue for a while change get really crazy and then end up with a big bang at the end
so that 's the way he made his piece and as adam says we then figured out the best way to have him perform his piece
it 's going to be looked at by this camera analyze his movements it 's going to let dan bring out all the different aspects of his music that he wants to
and you 're also going to notice a visual on the screen
we asked one of our students to look at what the camera is measuring
but instead of making it very literal showing you exactly the camera tracing we turned it into a graphic that shows you the basic movement and shows the way it 's being analyzed
i think it gives an understanding of how we 're picking out movement from what dan 's doing but i think it will also show you if you look at that movement that when dan makes music his motions are very purposeful very precise very disciplined and they 're also very beautiful
so in hearing this piece as i mentioned before the most important thing is the music 's great and it 'll show you who dan is
so are we ready adam
yeah
tm ok now dan will play his piece my eagle song for you
tm bravo
this is the venue where as a young man some of the music that i wrote was first performed
it was remarkably a pretty good sounding room
with all the uneven walls and all the crap everywhere it actually sounded pretty good
this is a song that was recorded there
this is not talking heads in the picture anyway
by talking heads so the nature of the room meant that words could be understood
the lyrics of the songs could be pretty much understood
the sound system was kind of decent
and there wasn 't a lot of reverberation in the room
so the rhythms could be pretty intact too pretty concise
other places around the country had similar rooms
this is tootsie 's orchid lounge in nashville
the music was in some ways different but in structure and form very much the same
the clientele behavior was very much the same too
and so the bands at tootsie 's or at cbgb 's had to play loud enough the volume had to be loud enough to overcome people falling down shouting out and doing whatever else they were doing
since then i 've played other places that are much nicer
i 've played the disney hall here and carnegie hall and places like that
and it 's been very exciting
but i also noticed that sometimes the music that i had written or was writing at the time didn 't sound all that great in some of those halls
we managed but sometimes those halls didn 't seem exactly suited to the music i was making or had made
so i asked myself do i write stuff for specific rooms
do i have a place a venue in mind when i write
is that a kind of model for creativity
do we all make things with a venue a context in mind
okay africa
most of the popular music that we know now has a big part of its roots in west africa
and the music there i would say the instruments the intricate rhythms the way it 's played the setting the context it 's all perfect it all works perfect
the music works perfectly in that setting
there 's no big room to create reverberation and confuse the rhythms
the instruments are loud enough that they can be heard without amplification etc etc
it 's no accident
it 's perfect for that particular context
and it would be a mess in a context like this this is a gothic cathedral
in a gothic cathedral this kind of music is perfect
it doesn 't change key the notes are long there 's almost no rhythm whatsoever and the room flatters the music
it actually improves it
this is the room that bach wrote some of his music for this is the organ
it 's not as big as a gothic cathedral so he can write things that are a little bit more intricate
he can very innovatively actually change keys without risking huge dissonances
this is a little bit later
this is the kind of rooms that mozart wrote in
i think we 're in like 1770 somewhere around there
they 're smaller even less reverberant so he can write really frilly music that 's very intricate and it works
it fits the room perfectly
this is la scala
it 's around the same time i think it was built around 1776
people in the audience in these opera houses when they were built they used to yell out to one another
they used to eat drink and yell out to people on the stage just like they do at cbgb 's and places like that
if they liked an aria they would holler and suggest that it be done again as an encore not at the end of the show but immediately
and well that was an opera experience
this is the opera house that wagner built for himself
and the size of the room is not that big
it 's smaller than this
but wagner made an innovation
he wanted a bigger band
he wanted a little more bombast so he increased the size of the orchestra pit so he could get more low-end instruments in there
okay
this is carnegie hall
obviously this kind of thing became popular
the halls got bigger carnegie hall 's fair-sized
it 's larger than some of the other symphony halls
and they 're a lot more reverberant than la scala
around the same according to alex ross who writes for the new yorker this kind of rule came into effect that audiences had to be quiet no more eating drinking and yelling at the stage or gossiping with one another during the show
they had to be very quiet
so those two things combined meant that a different kind of music worked best in these kind of halls
it meant that there could be extreme dynamics which there weren 't in some of these other kinds of music
quiet parts could be heard that would have been drowned out by all the gossiping and shouting
but because of the reverberation in those rooms like carnegie hall the music had to be maybe a little less rhythmic and a little more textural
this is mahler
it looks like bob dylan but it 's mahler
that was bob 's last record yeah
popular music coming along at the same time
this is a jazz band
according to scott joplin the bands were playing on riverboats and clubs
again it 's noisy they 're playing for dancers
there 's certain sections of the song the songs had different sections that the dancers really liked
and they 'd say play that part again
well there 's only so many times you can play the same section of a song over and over again for the dancers
so the bands started to improvise new melodies
and a new form of music was born
these are played mainly in small rooms
people are dancing shouting and drinking
so the music has to be loud enough to be heard above that
same thing goes true for that 's the beginning of the century for the whole of 20th-century popular music whether it 's rock or latin music or whatever
[ live music ] doesn 't really change that much
it changes about a third of the way into the 20th century when this became one of the primary venues for music
and this was one way that the music got there
microphones enabled singers in particular and musicians and composers to completely change the kind of music that they were writing
so far a lot of the stuff that was on the radio was live music but singers like frank sinatra could use the mic and do things that they could never do without a microphone
other singers after him went even further
this is chet baker
and this kind of thing would have been impossible without a microphone
it would have been impossible without recorded music as well
and he 's singing right into your ear
he 's whispering into your ears
the effect is just electric
it 's like the guy is sitting next to you whispering who knows what into your ear
so at this point music diverged
there 's live music and there 's recorded music
and they no longer have to be exactly the same
now there 's venues like this a discotheque and there 's jukeboxes in bars where you don 't even need to have a band
there doesn 't need to be any live performing musicians whatsoever and the sound systems are good
people began to make music specifically for discos and for those sound systems
and as with jazz the dancers liked certain sections more than they did others
so the early hip-hop guys would loop certain sections
the mc would improvise lyrics in the same way that the jazz players would improvise melodies
and another new form of music was born
live performance when it was incredibly successful ended up in what is probably acoustically the worst sounding venues on the planet sports stadiums basketball arenas and hockey arenas
musicians who ended up there did the best they could
they wrote what is now called arena rock which is medium-speed ballads
they did the best they could given that this is what they 're writing for
the tempos are medium it sounds big
it 's more a social situation than a musical situation
and in some ways the music that they 're writing for this place works perfectly
so there 's more new venues
one of the new ones is the automobile
i grew up with a radio in a car
but now that 's evolved into something else
the car is a whole venue
the music that i would say is written for automobile sound systems works perfectly on it
it might not be what you want to listen to at home but it works great in the car has a huge frequency spectrum you know big bass and high-end and the voice kind of stuck in the middle
automobile music you can share with your friends
there 's one other kind of new venue the private mp3 player
presumably this is just for christian music
and in some ways it 's like carnegie hall or when the audience had to hush up because you can now hear every single detail
in other ways it 's more like the west african music because if the music in an mp3 player gets too quiet you turn it up and the next minute your ears are blasted out by a louder passage
so that doesn 't really work
i think pop music mainly it 's written today to some extent is written for these kind of players for this kind of personal experience where you can hear extreme detail but the dynamic doesn 't change that much
so i asked myself okay is this a model for creation this adaptation that we do
and does it happen anywhere else
well according to david attenborough and some other people birds do it too that the birds in the canopy where the foliage is dense their calls tend to be high-pitched short and repetitive
and the birds on the floor tend to have lower pitched calls so that they don 't get distorted when they bounce off the forest floor
and birds like this savannah sparrow they tend to have a buzzing type call
and it turns out that a sound like this is the most energy efficient and practical way to transmit their call across the fields and savannahs
other birds like this tanager have adapted within the same species
the tananger on the east coast of the united states where the forests are a little denser has one kind of call and the tananger on the other side on the west has a different kind of call
so birds do it too
and i thought well if this is a model for creation if we make music primarily the form at least to fit these contexts and if we make art to fit gallery walls or museum walls and if we write software to fit existing operating systems is that how it works
yeah i think it 's evolutionary
it 's adaptive
but the pleasure and the passion and the joy is still there
this is a reverse view of things from the kind of traditional romantic view
the romantic view is that first comes the passion and then the outpouring of emotion and then somehow it gets shaped into something
and i 'm saying well the passion 's still there but the vessel that it 's going to be injected into and poured into that is instinctively and intuitively created first
we already know where that passion is going
but this conflict of views is kind of interesting
the writer thomas frank says that this might be a kind of explanation why some voters vote against their best interests that voters like a lot of us assume that if they hear something that sounds like it 's sincere that it 's coming from the gut that it 's passionate that it 's more authentic
and they 'll vote for that
so that if somebody can fake sincerity if they can fake passion they stand a better chance of being selected in that way which seems a little dangerous
i 'm saying the two the passion the joy are not mutually exclusive
maybe what the world needs now is for us to realize that we are like the birds
we adapt
we sing
and like the birds the joy is still there even though we have changed what we do to fit the context
thank you very much
for a long time in my life i felt like i 'd been living two different lives
there 's the life that everyone sees and then there 's the life that only i see
and in the life that everyone sees who i am is a friend a son a brother a stand-up comedian and a teenager
that 's the life everyone sees
if you were to ask my friends and family to describe me that 's what they would tell you
and that 's a huge part of me that is who i am
and if you were to ask me to describe myself i 'd probably say some of those same things
and i wouldn 't be lying but i wouldn 't totally be telling you the truth either because the truth is that 's just the life everyone else sees
in the life that only i see who i am who i really am is someone who struggles intensely with depression
i have for the last six years of my life and i continue to every day
now for someone who has never experienced depression or doesn 't really know what that means that might surprise them to hear because there 's this pretty popular misconception that depression is just being sad when something in your life goes wrong when you break up with your girlfriend when you lose a loved one when you don 't get the job you wanted
but that 's sadness that 's a natural thing
that 's a natural human emotion
real depression isn 't being sad when something in your life goes wrong
real depression is being sad when everything in your life is going right
that 's real depression and that 's what i suffer from
and to be totally honest that 's hard for me to stand up here and say
it 's hard for me to talk about and it seems to be hard for everyone to talk about so much so that no one 's talking about it
and no one 's talking about depression but we need to be because right now it 's a massive problem
it 's a massive problem
but we don 't see it on social media right
we don 't see it on facebook we don 't see it on twitter
we don 't see it on the news because it 's not happy it 's not fun it 's not light
and so because we don 't see it we don 't see the severity of it
but the severity of it and the seriousness of it is this every 30 seconds every 30 seconds somewhere someone in the world takes their own life because of depression and it might be two blocks away it might be two countries away it might be two continents away but it 's happening and it 's happening every single day
and we have a tendency as a society to look at that and go so what
so what we look at that and we go that 's your problem
that 's their problem
we say we 're sad and we say we 're sorry but we also say so what
well two years ago it was my problem because i sat on the edge of my bed where i 'd sat a million times before and i was suicidal
i was suicidal and if you were to look at my life on the surface you wouldn 't see a kid who was suicidal
you 'd see a kid who was the captain of his basketball team the drama and theater student of the year the english student of the year someone who was consistently on the honor roll and consistently at every party
so you would say i wasn 't depressed you would say i wasn 't suicidal but you would be wrong
you would be wrong so i sat there that night beside a bottle of pills with a pen and paper in my hand and i thought about taking my own life and i came this close to doing it
i came this close to doing it
and i didn 't so that makes me one of the lucky ones one of the people who gets to step out on the ledge and look down but not jump one of the lucky ones who survives
well i survived and that just leaves me with my story and my story is this in four simple words i suffer from depression
i suffer from depression and for a long time i think i was living two totally different lives where one person was always afraid of the other
i was afraid that people would see me for who i really was that i wasn 't the perfect popular kid in high school everyone thought i was that beneath my smile there was struggle and beneath my light there was dark and beneath my big personality just hid even bigger pain
see some people might fear girls not liking them back
some people might fear sharks some people might fear death
but for me for a large part of my life i feared myself
i feared my truth i feared my honesty i feared my vulnerability and that fear made me feel like i was forced into a corner like i was forced into a corner and there was only one way out and so i thought about that way every single day
i thought about it every single day and if i 'm being totally honest standing here i 've thought about it again since because that 's the sickness that 's the struggle that 's depression and depression isn 't chicken pox
you don 't beat it once and it 's gone forever
it 's something you live with it 's something you live in
it 's the roommate you can 't kick out it 's the voice you can 't ignore
it 's the feelings you can 't seem to escape the scariest part is that after a while you become numb to it it becomes normal for you and what you really fear the most isn 't the suffering inside of you
it 's the stigma inside of others it 's the shame it 's the embarrassment it 's the disapproving look on a friend 's face it 's the whispers in the hallway that you 're weak it 's the comments that you 're crazy
that 's what keeps you from getting help
that 's what makes you hold it in and hide it
it 's the stigma so you hold it in and you hide it and you hold it in and you hide it and even though it 's keeping you in bed every day and it 's making your life feel empty no matter how much you try and fill it you hide it because the stigma in our society around depression is very real
it 's very real and if you think that it isn 't ask yourself this would you rather make your next facebook status say you 're having a tough time getting out of bed because you hurt your back or you 're having a tough time getting out of bed every morning because you 're depressed
that 's the stigma because unfortunately we live in a world where if you break your arm everyone runs over to sign your cast but if you tell people you 're depressed everyone runs the other way
that 's the stigma
we are so so so accepting of any body part breaking down other than our brains and that 's ignorance
that 's pure ignorance and that ignorance has created a world that doesn 't understand depression that doesn 't understand mental health
and that 's ironic to me because depression is one of the best documented problems we have in the world yet it 's one of the least discussed
we just push it aside and put it in a corner and pretend it 's not there and hope it 'll fix itself
well it won 't it hasn 't and it 's not going to because that 's wishful thinking and wishful thinking isn 't a game plan it 's procrastination and we can 't procrastinate on something this important
the first step in solving any problem is recognizing there is one
well we haven 't done that so we can 't really expect to find an answer when we 're still afraid of the question
and i don 't know what the solution is
i wish i did but i don 't but i think i think it has to start here
it has to start with me it has to start with you it has to start with the people who are suffering the ones who are hidden in the shadows
we need to speak up and shatter the silence
we need to be the ones who are brave for what we believe in because if there 's one thing that i 've come to realize if there 's one thing that i see as the biggest problem it 's not in building a world where we eliminate the ignorance of others
it 's in building a world where we teach the acceptance of ourselves where we 're okay with who we are because when we get honest we see that we all struggle and we all suffer
whether it 's with this whether it 's with something else we all know what it is to hurt
we all know what it is to have pain in our heart and we all know how important it is to heal
but right now depression is society 's deep cut that we 're content to put a band-aid over and pretend it 's not there
well it is there it is there and you know what it 's okay
depression is okay if you 're going through it know that you 're okay
and know that you 're sick you 're not weak and it 's an issue not an identity because when you get past the fear and the ridicule and the judgment and the stigma of others you can see depression for what it really is and that 's just a part of life just a part of life and as much as i hate as much as i hate some of the places some of the parts of my life depression has dragged me down to in a lot of ways i 'm grateful for it
because yeah it 's put me in the valleys but only to show me there 's peaks and yeah it 's dragged me through the dark but only to remind me there is light
my pain more than anything in 19 years on this planet has given me perspective and my hurt my hurt has forced me to have hope have hope and to have faith faith in myself faith in others faith that it can get better that we can change this that we can speak up and speak out and fight back against ignorance fight back against intolerance and more than anything learn to love ourselves learn to accept ourselves for who we are the people we are not the people the world wants us to be
because the world i believe in is one where embracing your light doesn 't mean ignoring your dark
the world i believe in is one where we 're measured by our ability to overcome adversities not avoid them
the world i believe in is one where i can look someone in the eye and say i 'm going through hell and they can look back at me and go me too and that 's okay and it 's okay because depression is okay we 're people
we 're people and we struggle and we suffer and we bleed and we cry and if you think that true strength means never showing any weakness then i 'm here to tell you you 're wrong
you 're wrong because it 's the opposite
we 're people and we have problems
we 're not perfect and that 's okay
so we need to stop the ignorance stop the intolerance stop the stigma and stop the silence and we need to take away the taboos take a look at the truth and start talking because the only way we 're going to beat a problem that people are battling alone is by standing strong together by standing strong together
and i believe that we can
i believe that we can thank you guys so much
this is a dream come true thank you
thank you
on march 14 this year i posted this poster on facebook
this is an image of me and my daughter holding the israeli flag
i will try to explain to you about the context of why and when i posted
a few days ago i was sitting waiting on the line at the grocery store and the owner and one of the clients were talking to each other and the owner was explaining to the client that we 're going to get 10,000 missiles on israel
and the client was saying no it 's 10,000 a day
this is the context this is where we are now in israel
we have this war with iran coming for 10 years now and we have people you know afraid
it 's like every year it 's the last minute that we can do something about the war with iran
it 's like if we don 't act now it 's too late forever for 10 years now
so at some point it became you know to me i 'm a graphic designer so i made posters about it and i posted the one i just showed you before
most of the time i make posters i post them on facebook my friends like it don 't like it most of the time don 't like it don 't share it don 't nothing and it 's another day
so i went to sleep and that was it for me
and later on in the night i woke up because i 'm always waking up in the night and i went by the computer and i see all these red dots you know on facebook which i 've never seen before
and i was like what 's going on
so i come to the computer and i start looking on and suddenly i see many people talking to me most of them i don 't know and a few of them from iran which is what
because you have to understand in israel we don 't talk with people from iran
we don 't know people from iran
it 's like on facebook you have friends only from it 's like your neighbors are your friends on facebook
and now people from iran are talking to me
so i start answering this girl and she 's telling me she saw the poster and she asked her family to come because they don 't have a computer she asked her family to come to see the poster and they 're all sitting in the living room crying
so i 'm like whoa
i ask my wife to come and i tell her you have to see that
people are crying and she came she read the text and she started to cry
and everybody 's crying now
so i don 't know what to do so my first reflex as a graphic designer is you know to show everybody what i 'd just seen and people started to see them and to share them and that 's how it started
the day after when really it became a lot of talking i said to myself and my wife said to me i also want a poster so this is her
because it 's working put me in a poster now
but more seriously i was like okay these ones work but it 's not just about me it 's about people from israel who want to say something
so i 'm going to shoot all the people i know if they want and i 'm going to put them in a poster and i 'm going to share them
so i went to my neighbors and friends and students and i just asked them give me a picture i will make you a poster
and that 's how it started and that 's how really it 's unleashed because suddenly people from facebook friends and others just understand that they can be part of it
it 's not just one dude making one poster it 's we can be part of it so they start sending me pictures and ask me make me a poster post it
tell the iranians we from israel love you too
it became you know at some point it was really really intense
i mean so many pictures so i asked friends to come graphic designers most of them to make posters with me because i didn 't have the time
it was a huge amount of pictures
so for a few days that 's how my living room was
and we received israeli posters israeli images but also lots of comments lots of messages from iran
and we took these messages and we made posters out of it because i know people they don 't read they see images
if it 's an image they may read it
so here are a few of them
this one is really moving for me because it 's the story of a girl who has been raised in iran to walk on an israeli flag to enter her school every morning and now that she sees the posters that we 're sending she starts she said that she changed her mind and now she loves that blue she loves that star and she loves that flag talking about the israeli flag and she wished that we 'd meet and come to visit one another and just a few days after i posted the first poster
the day after iranians started to respond with their own posters
they have graphic designers what
crazy crazy
so you can see they are still shy they don 't want to show their faces but they want to spread the message
they want to respond they want to say the same thing
so and now it 's communication
it 's a two-way story it 's israelis and iranians sending the same message one to each other
this never happened before and this is two people supposed to be enemies we 're on the verge of a war and suddenly people on facebook are starting to say i like this guy i love those guys
and it became really big at some point
and then it became news
because when you 're seeing the middle east you see only the bad news
and suddenly there is something that was happening that was good news so the guys on the news they say okay let 's talk about this
and they just came and it was so much i remember one day michal she was talking with the journalist and she was asking him who 's gonna see the show and he said everybody
so she said everybody in palestine in where israel
who is everybody everybody
they said syria syria
lebanon lebanon
at some point he just said 40 million people are going to see you today
it 's everybody the chinese
and we were just at the beginning of the story
something crazy also happened
every time a country started talking about it like germany america wherever a page on facebook popped up with the same logo with the same stories so at the beginning we had iran-loves-israel which is an iranian sitting in tehran saying okay israel loves iran
i give you iran-loves-israel
you have palestine-loves-israel
you have lebanon that just a few days ago
and this whole list of pages on facebook dedicated to the same message to people sending their love one to each other
the moment i really understood that something was happening a friend of mine told me google the word israel and those were the first images on those days that popped up from google when you were typing israel or iran
we really changed how people see the middle east
because you 're not in the middle east
you 're somewhere over there and then you want to see the middle east so you go on google and you say israel and they give you the bad stuff
and for a few days you got those images
today the israel-loves-iran page is this number 80,831 and two million people last week went on the page and shared liked i don 't know commented on one of the photos
so for five months now that 's what we are doing me michal a few of my friends are just making images
we 're showing a new reality by just making images because that 's how the world perceives us
they see images of us and they see bad images
so we 're working on making good images end of story
look at this one this is the iran-loves-israel page
this is not the israel-loves-iran this is not my page
this is a guy in tehran on the day of remembrance of the israeli fallen soldier putting an image of an israeli soldier on his page
this is the enemy
what
and it 's going both ways
it 's like we are showing respect one to each other
and we 're understanding and you show compassion
and you become friends
and at some point you become friends on facebook and you become friends in life
you can go and travel and meet people
and i was in munich a few weeks ago
i went there to open an exposition about iran and i met there with people from the page that told me okay you 're going to be in europe i 'm coming i 'm coming from france from holland from germany of course and from israel people came and we just met there for the first time in real life
i met with people that are supposed to be my enemies for the first time and we just shake hands and have a coffee and a nice discussion and we talk about food and basketball
and that was the end of it
remember that image from the beginning
at some point we met in real life and we became friends
and it goes the other way around
some girl that we met on facebook never been in israel born and raised in iran lives in germany afraid of israelis because of what she knows about us decides after a few months of talking on the internet with some israelis to come to israel and she gets on the plane and arrives at ben gurion and says okay not that big a deal
so a few weeks ago the stress is getting higher so we start this new campaign called not ready to die in your war
i mean it 's plus minus the same message but we wanted really to add some aggressivity to it
and again something amazing happened something that we didn 't have on the first wave of the campaign
now people from iran the same ones who were shy at the first campaign and just sent you know their foot and half their faces now they 're sending their faces and they 're saying okay no problem we 're into it we are with you
just read where those guys are from
and for every guy from israel you 've got someone from iran
just people sending their pictures
crazy yes
so so you may ask yourself who is this dude
my name is ronny edry and i 'm 41 i 'm an israeli i 'm a father of two i 'm a husband and i 'm a graphic designer i 'm teaching graphic design
and i 'm not that naive because a lot of the time i 've been asked many times i 've been asked yeah but this is really naive sending flowers over i mean i was in the army i was in the paratroopers for three years and i know how it looks from the ground
i know how it can look really bad
so to me this is the courageous thing to do to try to reach the other side before it 's too late because when it 's going to be too late it 's going to be too late
and sometimes war is inevitable sometimes but maybe [ with ] effort we can avoid it
maybe as people because especially in israel we 're in a democracy we have the freedom of speech and maybe that little thing can change something
and really we can be our own ambassadors
we can just send a message and hope for the best
so i want to ask michal my wife to come with me on the stage just to make with you one image because it 's all about images
and maybe that image will help us change something
just raise that exactly
and i 'm just going to take a picture of it and i 'm just going to post it on facebook with kind of israelis for peace or something
oh my god
don 't cry
thank you guys
let 's talk trash
you know we had to be taught to renounce the powerful conservation ethic we developed during the great depression and world war ii
after the war we needed to direct our enormous production capacity toward creation of products for peacetime
life magazine helped in this effort by announcing the introduction of throwaways that would liberate the housewife from the drudgery of doing dishes
mental note to the liberators throwaway plastics take a lot of space and don 't biodegrade
only we humans make waste that nature can 't digest
plastics are also hard to recycle
a teacher told me how to express the under-five-percent of plastics recovered in our waste stream
it 's diddly-point-squat
that 's the percentage we recycle
now melting point has a lot to do with this
plastic is not purified by the re-melting process like glass and metal
it begins to melt below the boiling point of water and does not drive off the oily contaminants for which it is a sponge
half of each year 's 100 billion pounds of thermal plastic pellets will be made into fast-track trash
a large unruly fraction of our trash will flow downriver to the sea
here is the accumulation at biona creek next to the l.a. airport
and here is the flotsam near california state university long beach and the diesel plant we visited yesterday
in spite of deposit fees much of this trash leading out to the sea will be plastic beverage bottles
we use two million of them in the united states every five minutes here imaged by ted presenter chris jordan who artfully documents mass consumption and zooms in for more detail
here is a remote island repository for bottles off the coast of baja california
isla san roque is an uninhabited bird rookery off baja 's sparsely populated central coast
notice that the bottles here have caps on them
bottles made of polyethylene terephthalate pet will sink in seawater and not make it this far from civilization
also the caps are produced in separate factories from a different plastic polypropylene
they will float in seawater but unfortunately do not get recycled under the bottle bills
let 's trace the journey of the millions of caps that make it to sea solo
after a year the ones from japan are heading straight across the pacific while ours get caught in the california current and first head down to the latitude of cabo san lucas
after ten years a lot of the japanese caps are in what we call the eastern garbage patch while ours litter the philippines
after 20 years we see emerging the debris accumulation zone of the north pacific gyre
it so happens that millions of albatross nesting on kure and midway atolls in the northwest hawaiian islands national monument forage here and scavenge whatever they can find for regurgitation to their chicks
a four-month old laysan albatross chick died with this in its stomach
hundreds of thousands of the goose-sized chicks are dying with stomachs full of bottle caps and other rubbish like cigarette lighters ...
but mostly bottle caps
sadly their parents mistake bottle caps for food tossing about in the ocean surface
the retainer rings for the caps also have consequences for aquatic animals
this is mae west still alive at a zookeeper 's home in new orleans
i wanted to see what my home town of long beach was contributing to the problem so on coastal clean-up day in 2005 i went to the long beach peninsula at the east end of our long beach
we cleaned up the swaths of beach shown
i offered five cents each for bottle caps
i got plenty of takers
here are the 1,100 bottle caps they collected
i thought i would spend 20 bucks
that day i ended up spending nearly 60
i separated them by color and put them on display the next earth day at cabrillo marine aquarium in san pedro
governor schwarzenegger and his wife maria stopped by to discuss the display
in spite of my girly man hat crocheted from plastic shopping bags they shook my hand
i showed him and maria a zooplankton trawl from the gyre north of hawaii with more plastic than plankton
here 's what our trawl samples from the plastic soup our ocean has become look like
trawling a zooplankton net on the surface for a mile produces samples like this
and this
now when the debris washes up on the beaches of hawaii it looks like this
and this particular beach is kailua beach the beach where our president and his family vacationed before moving to washington
now how do we analyze samples like this one that contain more plastic than plankton
we sort the plastic fragments into different size classes from five millimeters to one-third of a millimeter
small bits of plastic concentrate persistent organic pollutants up to a million times their levels in the surrounding seawater
we wanted to see if the most common fish in the deep ocean at the base of the food chain was ingesting these poison pills
we did hundreds of necropsies and over a third had polluted plastic fragments in their stomachs
the record-holder only two-and-a-half inches long had 84 pieces in its tiny stomach
now you can buy certified organic produce
but no fishmonger on earth can sell you a certified organic wild-caught fish
this is the legacy we are leaving to future generations
the throwaway society cannot be contained it has gone global
we simply cannot store and maintain or recycle all our stuff
we have to throw it away
now the market can do a lot for us but it can 't fix the natural system in the ocean we 've broken
all the king 's horses and all the king 's men ...
will never gather up all the plastic and put the ocean back together again
narrator the levels are increasing the amount of packaging is increasing the throwaway concept of living is proliferating and it 's showing up in the ocean
anchor he offers no hope of cleaning it up
straining the ocean for plastic would be beyond the budget of any country and it might kill untold amounts of sea life in the process
the solution moore says is to stop the plastic at its source stop it on land before it falls in the ocean
and in a plastic-wrapped and packaged world he doesn 't hold out much hope for that either
this is brian rooney for nightline in long beach california
charles moore thank you
how do you feed a city
it 's one of the great questions of our time
yet it 's one that 's rarely asked
we take it for granted that if we go into a shop or restaurant or indeed into this theater 's foyer in about an hour 's time there is going to be food there waiting for us having magically come from somewhere
but when you think that every day for a city the size of london enough food has to be produced transported bought and sold cooked eaten disposed of and that something similar has to happen every day for every city on earth it 's remarkable that cities get fed at all
we live in places like this as if they 're the most natural things in the world forgetting that because we 're animals and that we need to eat we 're actually as dependent on the natural world as our ancient ancestors were
and as more of us move into cities more of that natural world is being transformed into extraordinary landscapes like the one behind me it 's soybean fields in mato grosso in brazil in order to feed us
these are extraordinary landscapes but few of us ever get to see them
and increasingly these landscapes are not just feeding us either
as more of us move into cities more of us are eating meat so that a third of the annual grain crop globally now gets fed to animals rather than to us human animals
and given that it takes three times as much grain actually ten times as much grain to feed a human if it 's passed through an animal first that 's not a very efficient way of feeding us
and it 's an escalating problem too
by 2050 it 's estimated that twice the number of us are going to be living in cities
and it 's also estimated that there is going to be twice as much meat and dairy consumed
so meat and urbanism are rising hand in hand
and that 's going to pose an enormous problem
six billion hungry carnivores to feed by 2050
that 's a big problem and actually if we carry on as we are it 's a problem we 're very unlikely to be able to solve
nineteen million hectares of rainforest are lost every year to create new arable land
although at the same time we 're losing an equivalent amount of existing arables to salinization and erosion
we 're very hungry for fossil fuels too
it takes about 10 calories to produce every calorie of food that we consume in the west
and even though there is food that we are producing at great cost we don 't actually value it
half the food produced in the usa is currently thrown away
and to end all of this at the end of this long process we 're not even managing to feed the planet properly
a billion of us are obese while a further billion starve
none of it makes very much sense
and when you think that 80 percent of global trade in food now is controlled by just five multinational corporations it 's a grim picture
as we 're moving into cities the world is also embracing a western diet
and if we look to the future it 's an unsustainable diet
so how did we get here
and more importantly what are we going to do about it
well to answer the slightly easier question first about 10,000 years ago i would say is the beginning of this process in the ancient near east known as the fertile crescent
because as you can see it was crescent shaped
and it was also fertile
and it was here about 10,000 years ago that two extraordinary inventions agriculture and urbanism happened roughly in the same place and at the same time
this is no accident because agriculture and cities are bound together they need each other
because it was discovery of grain by our ancient ancestors for the first time that produced a food source that was large enough and stable enough to support permanent settlements
and if we look at what those settlements were like we see they were compact
they were surrounded by productive farm land and dominated by large temple complexes like this one at ur that were in fact effectively spiritualized central food distribution centers
because it was the temples that organized the harvest gathered in the grain offered it to the gods and then offered the grain that the gods didn 't eat back to the people
so if you like the whole spiritual and physical life of these cities was dominated by the grain and the harvest that sustained them
and in fact that 's true of every ancient city
but of course not all of them were that small
famously rome had about a million citizens by the first century a.d.
so how did a city like this feed itself
the answer is what i call ancient food miles
basically rome had access to the sea which made it possible for it to import food from a very long way away
this is the only way it was possible to do this in the ancient world because it was very difficult to transport food over roads which were rough
and the food obviously went off very quickly
so rome effectively waged war on places like carthage and egypt just to get its paws on their grain reserves
and in fact you could say that the expansion of the empire was really sort of one long drawn out militarized shopping spree really
in fact i love the fact i just have to mention this rome in fact used to import oysters from london at one stage i think that 's extraordinary
so rome shaped its hinterland through its appetite
but the interesting thing is that the other thing also happened in the pre-industrial world
if we look at a map of london in the 17th century we can see that its grain which is coming in from the thames along the bottom of this map
so the grain markets were to the south of the city
and the roads leading up from them to cheapside which was the main market were also grain markets
and if you look at the name of one of those streets bread street you can tell what was going on there 300 years ago
and the same of course was true for fish
fish was of course coming in by river as well same thing
and of course billingsgate famously was london 's fish market operating on-site here until the mid-1980s
which is extraordinary really when you think about it
everybody else was wandering around with mobile phones that looked like bricks and sort of smelly fish happening down on the port
this is another thing about food in cities once its roots into the city are established they very rarely move
meat is a very different story because of course animals could walk into the city
so much of london 's meat was coming from the northwest from scotland and wales
so it was coming in and arriving at the city at the northwest which is why smithfield london 's very famous meat market was located up there
poultry was coming in from east anglia and so on to the northeast
i feel a bit like a weather woman doing this anyway and so the birds were coming in with their feet protected with little canvas shoes
and then when they hit the eastern end of cheapside that 's where they were sold which is why it 's called poultry
and in fact if you look at the map of any city built before the industrial age you can trace food coming in to it
you can actually see how it was physically shaped by food both by reading the names of the streets which give you a lot of clues
friday street in a previous life is where you went to buy your fish on a friday
but also you have to imagine it full of food
because the streets and the public spaces were the only places where food was bought and sold
and if we look at an image of smithfield in 1830 you can see that it would have been very difficult to live in a city like this and be unaware of where your food came from
in fact if you were having sunday lunch the chances were it was mooing or bleating outside your window about three days earlier
so this was obviously an organic city part of an organic cycle
and then 10 years later everything changed
this is an image of the great western in 1840
and as you can see some of the earliest train passengers were pigs and sheep
so all of a sudden these animals are no longer walking into market
they 're being slaughtered out of sight and mind somewhere in the countryside
and they 're coming into the city by rail
and this changes everything
to start off with it makes it possible for the first time to grow cities really any size and shape in any place
cities used to be constrained by geography they used to have to get their food through very difficult physical means
all of a sudden they are effectively emancipated from geography
and as you can see from these maps of london in the 90 years after the trains came it goes from being a little blob that was quite easy to feed by animals coming in on foot and so on to a large splurge that would be very very difficult to feed with anybody on foot either animals or people
and of course that was just the beginning after the trains came cars and really this marks the end of this process
it 's the final emancipation of the city from any apparent relationship with nature at all
and this is the kind of city that 's devoid of smell devoid of mess certainly devoid of people because nobody would have dreamed of walking in such a landscape
in fact what they did to get food was they got in their cars drove to a box somewhere on the outskirts came back with a week 's worth of shopping and wondered what on earth to do with it
and this really is the moment when our relationship both with food and cities changes completely
here we have food that used to be the center the social core of the city at the periphery
it used to be a social event buying and selling food
now it 's anonymous
we used to cook now we just add water or a little bit of an egg if you 're making a cake or something
we don 't smell food to see if it 's okay to eat
we just read the back of a label on a packet
and we don 't value food we don 't trust it
so instead of trusting it we fear it
and instead of valuing it we throw it away
one of the great ironies of modern food systems is that they 've made the very thing they promised to make easier much harder
by making it possible to build cities anywhere and any place they 've actually distanced us from our most important relationship which is that of us and nature
and also they 've made us dependent on systems that only they can deliver that as we 've seen are unsustainable
so what are we going to do about that
it 's not a new question
500 years ago it 's what thomas more was asking himself
this is the frontispiece of his book utopia
and it was a series of semi-independent city-states if that sounds remotely familiar a day 's walk from one another where everyone was basically farming-mad and grew vegetables in their back gardens and ate communal meals together and so on
and i think you could argue that food is a fundamental ordering principle of utopia even though more never framed it that way
and here is another very famous utopian vision that of ebenezer howard the garden city
same idea series of semi-independent city-states little blobs of metropolitan stuff with arable land around joined to one another by railway
and again food could be said to be the ordering principle of his vision
it even got built but nothing to do with this vision that howard had
and that is the problem with these utopian ideas that they are utopian
utopia was actually a word that thomas moore used deliberately
it was a kind of joke because it 's got a double derivation from the greek
it can either mean a good place or no place
because it 's an ideal it 's an imaginary thing we can 't have it
and i think as a conceptual tool for thinking about the very deep problem of human dwelling that makes it not much use
so i 've come up with an alternative which is sitopia from the ancient greek sitos for food and topos for place
i believe we already live in sitopia
we live in a world shaped by food and if we realize that we can use food as a really powerful tool a conceptual tool design tool to shape the world differently
so if we were to do that what might sitopia look like
well i think it looks a bit like this
i have to use this slide it 's just the look on the face of the dog
but anyway this is it 's food at the center of life at the center of family life being celebrated being enjoyed people taking time for it
this is where food should be in our society
but you can 't have scenes like this unless you have people like this
by the way these can be men as well
it 's people who think about food who think ahead who plan who can stare at a pile of raw vegetables and actually recognize them
we need these people we 're part of a network
because without these kinds of people we can 't have places like this
here i deliberately chose this because it is a man buying a vegetable
but networks markets where food is being grown locally
it 's common it 's fresh
it 's part of the social life of the city
because without that you can 't have this kind of place food that is grown locally and also is part of the landscape and is not just a zero-sum commodity off in some unseen hell-hole
cows with a view
steaming piles of humus
this is basically bringing the whole thing together
and this is a community project i visited recently in toronto
it 's a greenhouse where kids get told all about food and growing their own food
here is a plant called kevin or maybe it 's a plant belonging to a kid called kevin i don 't know
but anyway these kinds of projects that are trying to reconnect us with nature is extremely important
so sitopia for me is really a way of seeing
it 's basically recognizing that sitopia already exists in little pockets everywhere
the trick is to join them up to use food as a way of seeing
and if we do that we 're going to stop seeing cities as big metropolitan unproductive blobs like this
we 're going to see them more like this as part of the productive organic framework of which they are inevitably a part symbiotically connected
but of course that 's not a great image either because we need not to be producing food like this anymore
we need to be thinking more about permaculture which is why i think this image just sums up for me the kind of thinking we need to be doing
it 's a re-conceptualization of the way food shapes our lives
the best image i know of this is from 650 years ago
it 's ambrogio lorenzetti 's allegory of good government
it 's about the relationship between the city and the countryside
and i think the message of this is very clear
if the city looks after the country the country will look after the city
and i want us to ask now what would ambrogio lorenzetti paint if he painted this image today
what would an allegory of good government look like today
because i think it 's an urgent question
it 's one we have to ask and we have to start answering
we know we are what we eat
we need to realize that the world is also what we eat
but if we take that idea we can use food as a really powerful tool to shape the world better
thank you very much
this is about a place in london called kiteflyer 's hill where i used to go and spend hours going when is he coming back when is he coming back
so this is another one dedicated to that guy ...
who i 've got over
but this is kiteflyer 's hill
it 's a beautiful song written by a guy called martin evan actually for me
boo hewerdine thomas dolby thank you very much for inviting me it 's been a blessing singing for you
thank you very much
do you remember when we used to go up to kiteflyer 's hill those summer nights so still with all of the city beneath us and all of our lives ahead before cruel and foolish words were cruelly and foolishly said some nights i think of you and then i go up on kiteflyer 's hill wrapped up against the winter chill and somewhere in the city beneath me you lie asleep in your bed and i wonder if ever just briefly do i creep in your dreams now and then where are you now my wild summer love where are you now have the years been kind and do you think of me sometimes up on kiteflyer 's hill oh i pray you one day will we won 't say a word we won 't need them sometimes silence is best we 'll just stand in the still of the evening and whisper farewell to loneliness where are you now my wild summer love where are you now do you think of me sometimes and do you ever make that climb where are you now my wild summer love where are you now have the years been kind and do you ever make that climb up on kiteflyer 's hill kiteflyer 's ... [ french ] where are you where are you now where are you now kiteflyer 's ... gracias thank you very much
i was asked by wilsonart international a plastic laminate company which is the largest plastic laminate company in the world they asked me to design a trade show booth for exhibition at the international contemporary furniture fair in new york in 2000
so looking at their three main markets for their product which were basically transportation design interiors and furniture we came up with the solution of taking an old airstream trailer and gutting it and trying to portray laminate and a trailer in kind of a fresh new contemporary look
when this trailer showed up at my shop in berkeley i 'd actually never stepped foot in an airstream trailer or any other trailer
so i can be somebody that can look at this in a totally fresh perspective and see if i can optimize it in its most idealistic fashion
i decided i had to do some research and really figure out what had gone wrong somewhere along the history of airstream
what i discovered in these interiors is that there was a disconnect between the exterior shell and the interior architecture of the pieces
in that the shell was originally conceived as a lightweight modern futuristic high-tech pod for hurtling down the freeway and the interiors were completely out of sync with that
in fact it appeared like they referenced a mountain cabin
that seemed really like a crisis to me that they had never been able to develop a vocabulary about escape and about travel and modernity in this trailer that was consistent with the shell
we really needed to do some archeology in the trailer itself to figure out what 's authentic in an airstream trailer and what feels like it has true purpose and utility
we stripped out all the vinyl and zolatone paint that was covering up this just fantastic aluminum shell
we took off all the visible hardware and trim that was kind of doing the country cabin thing
i literally drew on the walls of the trailer mocked it up in cardboard we 'd come in and cut decide things were wrong pull it out put it back in
the main goal was to smooth out the interior and begin to speak about motion and mobility and independence
the biggest difficulty on one of these trailers is that when you 're designing there 's actually no logical place to stop and start materials because of the continuous form of the trailer
there 's no such things as two walls and a ceiling coming together where you can change materials and shapes
so that became a challenge
compounding that the material of choice laminate that i was trying to highlight only bends in two dimensions
it 's a compound curve interior
what i had to devise was a way of fooling the eye into believing that all these panels are curved with the shell
what i came up with was a series of second skins that basically float over the aluminum shell
and what i was trying to do there was direct your eye in the space so that you would perceive the geometry in a different way and that the casework wouldn 't break up the space
they also gave us a way to run power and rewire the trailer without tearing out the skin so they function as an electrical chase
that 's the trailer pretty much finished
that trailer led to another commission to participate in whats called tokyo designers block
its a week of furniture design events in tokyo in october
teruo kurosaki who owns a furniture company called idee he asked me to ship him two trailers to tokyo
he said one he would like to make a real trailer functioning and we would sell that one
trailer number two you have a blank slate you can to anything you want
we came up with a fantasy scenario of a dj traveling around the states that would collect records and go on tours
this trailer housed two turntables mixer wet bar fridge integrated sound system
it 's got a huge couch fits quite a few people and basically we 'd had a great time with this
and so in this trailer i took it upon myself to think about travel and escape in an idiosyncratic sense
a lot of these ideas migrated into the production trailers for airstream
this brings us up to the time that i started consulting to airstream
they came to me and said well what can we do to freshen this thing up
and do you think kids you know skateboarders surfers rock climbers would use these things
and i said well not in that interior
anyway i went out to airstream about six times during the process of building this prototype and it 's called the bambi prototype
i thought finally oh yeah great big company i 'm gonna work with somebody with money for tooling and molding
and i walked in their prototype facility and it 's exactly like my shop only bigger same tools same things
so the problem became and they set this dilemma to me that you have to design the interior using only our existing technology and there 's no money for tooling or molding
the trailers themselves are actually hand-built
all the casework is hand-scribed in uniquely so you can 't just cut 100 parts for 100 trailers you have to cut them big and every single one is hand-fit
they didn 't want to go to a componentized system
and there it is that 's the bambi 16
i 'm a pediatrician and an anesthesiologist so i put children to sleep for a living
and i 'm an academic so i put audiences to sleep for free
but what i actually mostly do is i manage the pain management service at the packard children 's hospital up at stanford in palo alto
and it 's from the experience from about 20 or 25 years of doing that that i want to bring to you the message this morning that pain is a disease
now most of the time you think of pain as a symptom of a disease and that 's true most of the time
it 's the symptom of a tumor or an infection or an inflammation or an operation
but about 10 percent of the time after the patient has recovered from one of those events pain persists
it persists for months and oftentimes for years and when that happens it is its own disease
and before i tell you about how it is that we think that happens and what we can do about it i want to show you how it feels for my patients
so imagine if you will that i 'm stroking your arm with this feather as i 'm stroking my arm right now
now i want you to imagine that i 'm stroking it with this
please keep your seat
a very different feeling
now what does it have to do with chronic pain
imagine if you will these two ideas together
imagine what your life would be like if i were to stroke it with this feather but your brain was telling you that this is what you are feeling and that is the experience of my patients with chronic pain
in fact imagine something even worse
imagine i were to stroke your child 's arm with this feather and their brain [ was ] telling them that they were feeling this hot torch
that was the experience of my patient chandler whom you see in the photograph
as you can see she 's a beautiful young woman
she was 16 years old last year when i met her and she aspired to be a professional dancer
and during the course of one of her dance rehearsals she fell on her outstretched arm and sprained her wrist
now you would probably imagine as she did that a wrist sprain is a trivial event in a person 's life
wrap it in an ace bandage take some ibuprofen for a week or two and that 's the end of the story
but in chandler 's case that was the beginning of the story
this is what her arm looked like when she came to my clinic about three months after her sprain
you can see that the arm is discolored purplish in color
it was cadaverically cold to the touch
the muscles were frozen paralyzed dystonic is how we refer to that
the pain had spread from her wrist to her hands to her fingertips from her wrist up to her elbow almost all the way to her shoulder
but the worst part was not the spontaneous pain that was there 24 hours a day
the worst part was that she had allodynia the medical term for the phenomenon that i just illustrated with the feather and with the torch
the lightest touch of her arm the touch of a hand the touch even of a sleeve of a garment as she put it on caused excruciating burning pain
how can the nervous system get this so wrong
how can the nervous system misinterpret an innocent sensation like the touch of a hand and turn it into the malevolent sensation of the touch of the flame
well you probably imagine that the nervous system in the body is hardwired like your house
in your house wires run in the wall from the light switch to a junction box in the ceiling and from the junction box to the light bulb
and when you turn the switch on the light goes on
and when you turn the switch off the light goes off
so people imagine the nervous system is just like that
if you hit your thumb with a hammer these wires in your arm that of course we call nerves transmit the information into the junction box in the spinal cord where new wires new nerves take the information up to the brain where you become consciously aware that your thumb is now hurt
but the situation of course in the human body is far more complicated than that
instead of it being the case that that junction box in the spinal cord is just simple where one nerve connects with the next nerve by releasing these little brown packets of chemical information called neurotransmitters in a linear one-on-one fashion in fact what happens is the neurotransmitters spill out in three dimensions laterally vertically up and down in the spinal cord and they start interacting with other adjacent cells
these cells called glial cells were once thought to be unimportant structural elements of the spinal cord that did nothing more than hold all the important things together like the nerves
but it turns out the glial cells have a vital role in the modulation amplification and in the case of pain the distortion of sensory experiences
these glial cells become activated
their dna starts to synthesize new proteins which spill out and interact with adjacent nerves and they start releasing their neurotransmitters and those neurotransmitters spill out and activate adjacent glial cells and so on and so forth until what we have is a positive feedback loop
it 's almost as if somebody came into your home and rewired your walls so that the next time you turned on the light switch the toilet flushed three doors down or your dishwasher went on or your computer monitor turned off
that 's crazy but that 's in fact what happens with chronic pain
and that 's why pain becomes its own disease
the nervous system has plasticity
it changes and it morphs in response to stimuli
well what do we do about that
what can we do in a case like chandler 's
we treat these patients in a rather crude fashion at this point in time
we treat them with symptom-modifying drugs painkillers which are frankly not very effective for this kind of pain
we take nerves that are noisy and active that should be quiet and we put them to sleep with local anesthetics
and most importantly what we do is we use a rigorous and often uncomfortable process of physical therapy and occupational therapy to retrain the nerves in the nervous system to respond normally to the activities and sensory experiences that are part of everyday life
and we support all of that with an intensive psychotherapy program to address the despondency despair and depression that always accompanies severe chronic pain
it 's successful as you can see from this video of chandler who two months after we first met her is now doings a back flip
and i had lunch with her yesterday because she 's a college student studying dance at long beach here and she 's doing absolutely fantastic
but the future is actually even brighter
the future holds the promise that new drugs will be developed that are not symptom-modifying drugs that simply mask the problem as we have now but that will be disease-modifying drugs that will actually go right to the root of the problem and attack those glial cells or those pernicious proteins that the glial cells elaborate that spill over and cause this central nervous system wind-up or plasticity that so is capable of distorting and amplifying the sensory experience that we call pain
so i have hope that in the future the prophetic words of george carlin will be realized who said my philosophy no pain no pain
thank you very much

today i 'm going to take you on a voyage to some place so deep so dark so unexplored that we know less about it than we know about the dark side of the moon
it 's a place of myth and legend
it 's a place marked on ancient maps as here be monsters
it is a place where each new voyage of exploration brings back new discoveries of creatures so wondrous and strange that our forefathers would have considered them monstrous indeed
instead they just make me green with envy that my colleague from iucn was able to go on this journey to the south of madagascar seamounts to actually take photographs and to see these wondrous creatures of the deep
we are talking about the high seas
the high seas is a legal term but in fact it covers 50 percent of the planet
with an average depth of the oceans of 4,000 meters in fact the high seas covers and provides nearly 90 percent of the habitat for life on this earth
it is in theory the global commons belonging to us all
but in reality it is managed by and for those who have the resources to go out and exploit it
so today i 'm going to take you on a voyage to cast light on some of the outdated myths and legends and assumptions that have kept us as the true stakeholders in the high seas in the dark
we 're going to voyage to some of these special places that we 've been discovering in the past few years to show why we really need to care
and then finally we 're going to try to develop and pioneer a new perspective on high seas governance that 's rooted in ocean-basin-wide conservation but framed in an arena of global norms of precaution and respect
so here is a picture of the high seas as seen from above that area in the darker blue
to me as an international lawyer this scared me far more than any of the creatures or the monsters we may have seen for it belies the notion that you can actually protect the ocean the global ocean that provides us all with carbon storage with heat storage with oxygen if you can only protect 36 percent
this is indeed the true heart of the planet
some of the problems that we have to confront are that the current international laws for example shipping provide more protection to the areas closest to shore
for example garbage discharge something you would think just simply goes away but the laws regulating ship discharge of garbage actually get weaker the further you are from shore
as a result we have garbage patches the size of twice-texas
it 's unbelievable
we used to think the solution to pollution was dilution but that has proved to be no longer the case
so what we have learned from social scientists and economists like elinor ostrom who are studying the phenomenon of management of the commons on a local scale is that there are certain prerequisites that you can put into place that enable you to manage and access open space for the good of one and all
and these include a sense of shared responsibility common norms that bind people together as a community
conditional access you can invite people in but they have to be able to play by the rules
and of course if you want people to play by the rules you still need an effective system of monitoring and enforcement for as we 've discovered you can trust but you also need to verify
what i 'd also like to convey is that it is not all doom and gloom that we are seeing in the high seas
for a group of very dedicated individuals scientists conservationists photographers and states were able to actually change a tragic trajectory that was destroying fragile seascapes such as this coral garden that you see in front of you
that is we 're able to save it from a fate of deep-sea bottom trawling
and how did we do that
well as i said we had a group of photographers that went out on board ships and actually photographed the activities in process
but we also spent many hours in the basements of the united nations trying to work with governments to make them understand what was going on so far away from land that few of us had ever even imagined that these creatures existed
so within three years from 2003 to 2006 we were able to get norm in place that actually changed the paradigm of how fishers went about deep-sea bottom trawling
instead of go anywhere do anything you want we actually created a regime that required prior assessment of where you 're going and a duty to prevent significant harm
in 2009 when the u.n. reviewed progress they discovered that almost 100 million square-kilometers of seabed had been protected
this does not mean that it 's the final solution or that this even provides permanent protection
but what it does mean is that a group of individuals can form a community to actually shape the way high seas are governed to create a new regime
so i 'm looking optimistically at our opportunities for creating a true blue perspective for this beautiful planet
sylvia 's wish provides us with that leverage that access to the heart of human beings you might say who have rarely seen places beyond their own toes but are now hopefully going to become interested in the full life-cycle of creatures like these sea turtles who indeed spend most of their time in the high seas
today we 're just going to voyage to a small sampling of some of these special areas just to give you an idea of the flavor of the riches and wonders they do contain
the sargasso sea for example is not a sea bounded by coastlines but it is bounded by oceanic currents that contain and envelope this wealth of sargassum that grows and aggregates there
it 's also known as the spawning ground for eels from northern european and northern american rivers that are now so dwindling in numbers that they 've actually stopped showing up in stockholm and five showed up in the u.k. just recently
but the sargasso sea the same way it aggregates sargassum weed actually is pulling in the plastic from throughout the region
this picture doesn 't exactly show the plastics that i would like it to show because i haven 't been out there myself
but there has just been a study that was released in february that showed there are 200,000 pieces of plastic per square-kilometer now floating in the surface of the sargasso sea and that is affecting the habitat for the many species in their juvenile stages who come to the sargasso sea for its protection and its food
the sargasso sea is also a wondrous place for the aggregation of these unique species that have developed to mimic the sargassum habitat
it also provides a special habitat for these flying fish to lay their eggs
but what i 'd like to get from this picture is that we truly do have an opportunity to launch a global initiative for protection
thus the government of bermuda has recognized the need and its responsibility as having some of the sargasso sea within its national jurisdiction but the vast majority is beyond to help spearhead a movement to achieve protection for this vital area
spinning down to someplace a little bit cooler than here right now the ross sea in the southern ocean
it 's actually a bay
it 's considered high seas because the continent has been put off limits to territorial claims
so anything in the water is treated as if it 's the high seas
but what makes the ross sea important is the vast sea of pack ice that in the spring and summer provides a wealth of phytoplankton and krill that supports what till recently has been a virtually intact near-shore ecosystem
but unfortunately ccamlr the regional commission in charge of conserving and managing fish stocks and other living marine resources is unfortunately starting to give in to fishing interests and has authorized the expansion of toothfish fisheries in the region
the captain of a new zealand vessel who was just down there is reporting a significant decline in the number of the ross sea killer whales who are directly dependent on the antarctic toothfish as their main source of food
so what we need to do is to stand up boldly singly and together to push governments to push regional fisheries management organizations to declare our right to declare certain areas off-limits to high seas fishing so that the freedom to fish no longer means the freedom to fish anywhere and anytime
coming closer to here the costa rica dome is a recently discovered area potentially year-round habitat for blue whales
there 's enough food there to last them the summer and the winter long
but what 's unusual about the costa rica dome is in fact it 's not a permanent place
it 's an oceanographic phenomenon that shifts in time and space on a seasonal basis
so in fact it 's not permanently in the high seas
it 's not permanently in the exclusive economic zones of these five central american countries but it moves with the season
as such it does create a challenge to protect but we also have a challenge protecting the species that move along with it
we can use the same technologies that fishers use to identify where the species are in order to close the area when it 's most vulnerable which may in some cases be year-round
getting closer to shore where we are this was in fact taken in the galapagos
many species are headed through this region which is why there 's been so much attention put into conservation of the eastern tropical pacific seascape
this is the initiative that 's been coordinated by conservation international with a variety of partners and governments to actually try to bring integrated management regime throughout the area
that is it provides a wonderful example of where you can go with a real regional initiative
it 's protecting five world heritage sites
unfortunately the world heritage convention does not recognize the need to protect areas beyond national jurisdiction at present
so a place like the costa rica dome could not technically qualify the time it 's in the high seas
so what we 've been suggesting is that we either need to amend the world heritage convention so that it can adopt and urge universal protection of these world heritage sites or we need to change the name and call it half-the-world heritage convention
but what we also know is that species like these sea turtles do not stay put in the eastern tropical pacific seascape
these happen to go down to a vast south pacific gyre where they spend most of their time and often end up getting hooked like this or as bycatch
so what i 'd really like to suggest is that we need to scale-up
we need to work locally but we also need to work ocean-basin-wide
we have the tools and technologies now to enable us to take a broader ocean-basin-wide initiative
we 've heard about the tagging of pacific predators project one of the 17 census of marine life projects
it 's provided us data like this of tiny little sooty shearwaters that make the entire ocean basin their home
they fly 65,000 kilometers in less than a year
so we have the tools and treasures coming from the census of marine life
and its culminating year that 's going to be launched in october
so stay tuned for further information
what i find so exciting is that the census of marine life has looked at more than the tagging of pacific predators it 's also looked in the really unexplored mid-water column where creatures like this flying sea cucumber have been found
and fortunately we 've been able as iucn to team up with the census of marine life and many of the scientists working there to actually try to translate much of this information to policymakers
we have the support of governments now behind us
we 've been revealing this information through technical workshops
and the exciting thing is that we do have sufficient information to move ahead to protect some of these significant hope spots hotspots
at the same time we 're saying yes we need more we need to move forward
but many of you have said if you get these marine protected areas or a reasonable regime for high seas fisheries management in place how are you going to enforce it
which leads me to my second passion besides ocean science which is outer space technology
i wanted to be an astronaut so i 've constantly followed what are the tools available to monitor earth from outer space and that we have incredible tools like we 've been learning about in terms of being able to follow tagged species throughout their life-cycles in the open ocean
we can also tag and track fishing vessels
many already have transponders on board that allow us to find out where they are and even what they 're doing
but not all the vessels have those to date
it does not take too much rocket science to actually try to create new laws to mandate if you 're going to have the privilege of accessing our high seas resources we need to know someone needs to know where you are and what you 're doing
so it brings me to my main take-home message which is we can avert a tragedy of the commons
we can stop the collision course of 50 percent of the planet with the high seas
but we need to think broad-scale we need to think globally
we need to change how we actually go about managing these resources
we need to get the new paradigm of precaution and respect
at the same time we need to think locally which is the joy and marvel of sylvia 's hope spot wish is that we can shine a spotlight on many of these previously unknown areas and to bring people to the table if you will to actually make them feel part of this community that truly has a stake in their future management
and third is that we need to look at ocean-basin-wide management
our species are ocean-basin-wide
many of the deep-sea communities have genetic distribution that goes ocean-basin-wide
we need to better understand but we also need to start to manage and protect
and in order to do that you also need ocean-basin management regimes
that is we have regional management regimes within the exclusive economic zone but we need to scale these up we need to build their capacity so they 're like the southern ocean where they do have the two-pronged fisheries and conservation organization
so with that i would just like to sincerely thank and honor sylvia earle for her wish for it is helping us to put a face on the high seas and the deep seas beyond national jurisdiction
it 's helping to bring an incredible group of talented people together to really try to solve and penetrate these problems that have created our obstacles to management and rational use of this area that was once so far away and remote
so on this tour i hope i provided you with a new perspective of the high seas one that it is our home too and that we need to work together if we are to make this a sustainable ocean future for us all
thank you
i want to share with you over the next 18 minutes a pretty incredible idea
actually it 's a really big idea
but to get us started i want to ask if everyone could just close your eyes for two seconds and try and think of a technology or a bit of science that you think has changed the world
now i bet in this audience you 're thinking of some really incredible technology some stuff that i haven 't even heard of i 'm absolutely sure
but i 'm also sure pretty sure that absolutely nobody is thinking of this
this is a polio vaccine
and it 's a great thing actually that nobody 's had to think about it here today because it means that we can take this for granted
this is a great technology
we can take it completely for granted
but it wasn 't always that way
even here in california if we were to go back just a few years it was a very different story
people were terrified of this disease
they were terrified of polio and it would cause public panic
and it was because of scenes like this
in this scene people are living in an iron lung
these are people who were perfectly healthy two or three days before and then two days later they can no longer breathe and this polio virus has paralyzed not only their arms and their legs but also their breathing muscles
and they were going to spend the rest of their lives usually in this iron lung to breathe for them
this disease was terrifying
there was no cure and there was no vaccine
the disease was so terrifying that the president of the united states launched an extraordinary national effort to find a way to stop it
twenty years later they succeeded and developed the polio vaccine
it was hailed as a scientific miracle in the late 1950s
finally a vaccine that could stop this awful disease and here in the united states it had an incredible impact
as you can see the virus stopped and it stopped very very fast
but this wasn 't the case everywhere in the world
and it happened so fast in the united states however that even just last month jon stewart said this jon stewart where is polio still active
because i thought that had been eradicated in the way that smallpox had been eradicated
bruce aylward oops jon polio 's almost been eradicated
but the reality is that polio still exists today
we made this map for jon to try to show him exactly where polio still exists
this is the picture
there 's not very much left in the world
but the reason there 's not very much left is because there 's been an extraordinary public private partnership working behind the scenes almost unknown i 'm sure to most of you here today
it 's been working for 20 years to try and eradicate this disease and it 's got it down to these few cases that you can see here on this graphic
but just last year we had an incredible shock and realized that almost just isn 't good enough with a virus like polio
and this is the reason in two countries that hadn 't had this disease for more than probably a decade on opposite sides of the globe there was suddenly terrible polio outbreaks
hundreds of people were paralyzed
hundreds of people died children as well as adults
and in both cases we were able to use genetic sequencing to look at the polio viruses and we could tell these viruses were not from these countries
they had come from thousands of miles away
and in one case it originated on another continent
and not only that but when they came into these countries then they got on commercial jetliners probably and they traveled even farther to other places like russia where for the first time in over a decade last year children were crippled and paralyzed by a disease that they had not seen for years
now all of these outbreaks that i just showed you these are under control now and it looks like they 'll probably stop very very quickly
but the message was very clear
polio is still a devastating explosive disease
it 's just happening in another part of the world
and our big idea is that the scientific miracle of this decade should be the complete eradication of poliomyelitis
so i want to tell you a little bit about what this partnership the polio partnership is trying to do
we 're not trying to control polio
we 're not trying to get it down to just a few cases because this disease is like a root fire it can explode again if you don 't snuff it out completely
so what we 're looking for is a permanent solution
we want a world in which every child just like you guys can take for granted a polio-free world
so we 're looking for a permanent solution and this is where we get lucky
this is one of the very few viruses in the world where there are big enough cracks in its armor that we can try to do something truly extraordinary
this virus can only survive in people
it can 't live for a very long time in people
it doesn 't survive in the environment hardly at all
and we 've got pretty good vaccines as i 've just showed you
so we are trying to wipe out this virus completely
what the polio eradication program is trying to do is to kill the virus itself that causes polio everywhere on earth
now we don 't have a great track record when it comes to doing something like this to eradicating diseases
it 's been tried six times in the last century and it 's been successful exactly once
and this is because disease eradication it 's still the venture capital of public health
the risks are massive but the pay-off economic humanitarian motivational it 's absolutely huge
one congressman here in the united states thinks that the entire investment that the u.s. put into smallpox eradication pays itself off every 26 days in foregone treatment costs and vaccination costs
and if we can finish polio eradication the poorest countries in the world are going to save over 50 billion dollars in the next 25 years alone
so those are the kind of stakes that we 're after
but smallpox eradication was hard it was very very hard
and polio eradication in many ways is even tougher and there 's a few reasons for that
the first is that when we started trying to eradicate polio about 20 years ago more than twice as many countries were infected than had been when we started off with smallpox
and there were more than 10 times as many people living in these countries
so it was a massive effort
the second challenge we had was in contrast to the smallpox vaccine which was very stable and a single dose protected you for life the polio vaccine is incredibly fragile
it deteriorates so quickly in the tropics that we 've had to put this special vaccine monitor on every single vial so that it will change very quickly when it 's exposed to too much heat and we can tell that it 's not a good vaccine to use on a child it 's not potent it 's not going to protect them
even then kids need many doses of the vaccine
but the third challenge we have and probably even bigger one the biggest challenge is that in contrast to smallpox where you could always see your enemy every single person almost who was infected with smallpox had this telltale rash
so you could get around the disease you could vaccinate around the disease and cut it off
with polio it 's almost completely different
the vast majority of people who are infected with the polio virus show absolutely no sign of the disease
so you can 't see the enemy most of the time and as a result we 've needed a very different approach to eradicate polio than what was done with smallpox
we 've had to create one of the largest social movements in history
there 's over 10 million people probably 20 million people largely volunteers who have been working over the last 20 years in what has now been called the largest internationally-coordinated operation in peacetime
these people these 20 million people vaccinate over 500 million children every single year multiple times at the peak of our operation
now giving the polio vaccine is simple
it 's just two drops like that
but reaching 500 million people is much much tougher
and these vaccinators these volunteers they have got to dive headlong into some of the toughest densest urban slums in the world
they 've got to trek under sweltering suns to some of the most remote difficult to reach places in the world
and they also have to dodge bullets because we have got to operate during shaky cease-fires and truces to try and vaccinate children even in areas affected by conflict
one reporter who was watching our program in somalia about five years ago a place which has eradicated polio not once but twice because they got reinfected
he was sitting outside of the road watching one of these polio campaigns unfold and a few months later he wrote this is foreign aid at its most heroic
and these heroes they come from every walk of life all sorts of backgrounds
but one of the most extraordinary is rotary international
this is a group whose million-strong army of volunteers have been working to eradicate polio for over 20 years
they 're right at the center of the whole thing
now it took years to build up the infrastructure for polio eradication more than 15 years much longer than it should have but once it was built the results were striking
within a couple of years every country that started polio eradication rapidly eradicated all three of their polio viruses with the exception of four countries that you see here
and in each of those it was only part of the country
and then by 1999 one of the three polio viruses that we were trying to eradicate had been completely eradicated worldwide proof of concept
and then today there 's been a 99 percent reduction greater than 99 percent reduction in the number of children who are being paralyzed by this awful disease
when we started over 20 years ago 1,000 children were being paralyzed every single day by this virus
last year it was 1,000
and at the same time the polio eradication program has been working to help with a lot of other areas
it 's been working to help control pandemic flu sars for example
it 's also tried to save children by doing other things giving vitamin a drops giving measles shots giving bed nets against malaria even during some of these campaigns
but the most exciting thing that the polio eradication program has been doing has been to force us the international community to reach every single child every single community the most vulnerable people in the world with the most basic of health services irrespective of geography poverty culture and even conflict
so things were looking very exciting and then about five years ago this virus this ancient virus started to fight back
the first problem we ran into was that in these last four countries the strongholds of this virus we just couldn 't seem to get the virus rooted out
and then to make the matters even worse the virus started to spread out of these four places especially northern india and northern nigeria into much of africa asia and even into europe causing horrific outbreaks in places that had not seen this disease for decades
and then in one of the most important tenacious and toughest reservoirs of the polio virus in the world we found that our vaccine was working half as well as it should have
in conditions like this the vaccine just couldn 't get the grip it needed to in the guts of these children and protect them the way that it needed to
now at that time there was a great as you can imagine frustration let 's call it frustration it started to grow very very quickly
and all of a sudden some very important voices in the world of public health started to say hang on
we should abandon this idea of eradication
let 's settle for control that 's good enough
now as seductive as the idea of control sounds it 's a false premise
the brutal truth is if we don 't have the will or the skill or even the money that we need to reach children the most vulnerable children in the world with something as simple as an oral polio vaccine then pretty soon more than 200,000 children are again going to be paralyzed by this disease every single year
there 's absolutely no question
these are children like umar
umar is seven years old and he 's from northern nigeria
he lives in a family home there with his eight brothers and sisters
umar also has polio
umar was paralyzed for life
his right leg was paralyzed in 2004
this leg his right leg now takes an awful beating because he has to half-crawl because it 's faster to move that way to keep up with his friends keep up with his brothers and sisters than to get up on his crutches and walk
but umar is a fantastic student he 's an incredible kid
as you probably can 't see the detail here but this is his report card and you 'll see he 's got perfect scores
he got 100 percent in all the important things like nursery rhymes for example there
but you know i 'd love to be able to tell you that umar is a typical kid with polio these days but it 's not true
umar is an exceptional kid in exceptional circumstances
the reality of polio today is something very different
polio strikes the poorest communities in the world
it leaves their children paralyzed and it drags their families deeper into poverty because they 're desperately searching and they 're desperately spending the little bit of savings that they have trying in vain to find a cure for their children
we think children deserve better
and so when the going got really tough in the polio eradication program about two years ago when people were saying we should call it off the polio partnership decided to buckle down once again and try and find innovative new solutions new ways to get to the children that we were missing again and again
in northern india we started mapping the cases using satellite imaging like this so that we could guide our investments and vaccinator shelters so we could get to the millions of children on the koshi river basin where there are no other health services
in northern nigeria the political leaders and the traditional muslim leaders they got directly involved in the program to help solve the problems of logistics and community confidence
and now they 've even started using these devices speaking of cool technology these little devices little gis trackers like this which they put into the vaccine carriers of their vaccinators
and then they can track them and at the end of the day they look and see did these guys get every single street every single house
this is the kind of commitment now we 're seeing to try and reach all of the children we 've been missing
and in afghanistan we 're trying new approaches access negotiators
we 're working closely with the international committee of the red cross to ensure that we can reach every child
but as we tried these extraordinary things as people went to this trouble to try and rework their tactics we went back to the vaccine it 's a 50-year-old vaccine and we thought surely we can make a better vaccine so that when they finally get to these kids we can have a better bang for our buck
and this started an incredible collaboration with industry and within six months we were testing a new polio vaccine that targeted just two years ago the last two types of polio in the world
now june the ninth 2009 we got the first results from the first trial with this vaccine and it turned out to be a game-changer
the new vaccine had twice the impact on these last couple of viruses as the old vaccine had and we immediately started using this
well in a couple of months we had to get it out of production
and it started rolling off the production lines and into the mouths of children around the world
and we didn 't start with the easy places
the first place this vaccine was used was in southern afghanistan because it 's in places like that where kids are going to benefit the most from technologies like this
now here at ted over the last couple of days i 've seen people challenging the audience again and again to believe in the impossible
so this morning at about seven o 'clock i decided that we 'd try to drive chris and the production crew here berserk by downloading all of our data from india again so that you could see something that 's just unfolding today which proves that the impossible is possible
and only two years ago people were saying that this is impossible
now remember northern india is the perfect storm when it comes to polio
over 500,000 children are born in the two states that have never stopped polio uttar pradesh and bihar 500,000 children every single month
sanitation is terrible and our old vaccine you remember worked half as well as it should have
and yet the impossible is happening
today marks exactly six months and for the first time in history not a single child has been paralyzed in uttar pradesh or bihar
india 's not unique
in umar 's home country of nigeria a 95 percent reduction in the number of children paralyzed by polio last year
and in the last six months we 've had less places reinfected by polio than at any other time in history
ladies and gentlemen with a combination of smart people smart technology and smart investments polio can now be eradicated anywhere
we have major challenges you can imagine to finish this job but as you 've also seen it 's doable it has great secondary benefits and polio eradication is a great buy
and as long as any child anywhere is paralyzed by this virus it 's a stark reminder that we are failing as a society to reach children with the most basic of services
and for that reason polio eradication it 's the ultimate in equity and it 's the ultimate in social justice
the huge social movement that 's been involved in polio eradication is ready to do way more for these children
it 's ready to reach them with bed nets with other things
but capitalizing on their enthusiasm capitalizing on their energy means finishing the job that they started 20 years ago
finishing polio is a smart thing to do and it 's the right thing to do
now we 're in tough times economically
but as david cameron of the united kingdom said about a month ago when he was talking about polio there 's never a wrong time to do the right thing
finishing polio eradication is the right thing to do
and we are at a crossroads right now in this great effort over the last 20 years
we have a new vaccine we have new resolve and we have new tactics
we have the chance to write an entirely new polio-free chapter in human history
but if we blink now we will lose forever the chance to eradicate an ancient disease
here 's a great idea to spread end polio now
help us tell the story
help us build the momentum so that very soon every child every parent everywhere can also take for granted a polio-free life forever
thank you
bill gates well bruce where do you think the toughest places are going to be
where would you say we need to be the smartest
b the four places where you saw that we 've never stopped northern nigeria northern india the southern corner of afghanistan and bordering areas of pakistan they 're going to be the toughest
but the interesting thing is of those three india 's looking real good as you just saw in the data
and afghanistan afghanistan we think has probably stopped polio repeatedly
it keeps getting reinfected
so the tough ones going to get the top of nigeria finished and getting pakistan finished
they 're going to be the tough ones
now what about the money
give us a sense of how much the campaign costs a year
and is it easy to raise that money
and what 's it going to be like the next couple of years
b it 's interesting
we spend right now about 750 million to 800 million dollars a year
that 's what it costs to reach 500 million children
it sounds like a lot of money it is a lot of money
but when you 're reaching 500 million children multiple times 20 30 cents to reach a child that 's not very much money
but right now we don 't have enough of that
we have a big gap in that money we 're cutting corners and every time we cut corners more places get infected that shouldn 't have and it just slows us down
and that great buy costs us a little bit more
well hopefully we 'll get the word out and the governments will keep their generosity up
so good luck we 're all in this with you
thank you

hi my name is frank and i collect secrets
it all started with a crazy idea in november of 2004
i printed up 3,000 self-addressed postcards just like this
they were blank on one side and on the other side i listed some simple instructions
i asked people to anonymously share an artful secret they 'd never told anyone before
and i handed out these postcards randomly on the streets of washington d.c. not knowing what to expect
but soon the idea began spreading virally
people began to buy their own postcards and make their own postcards
i started receiving secrets in my home mailbox not just with postmarks from washington d.c. but from texas california vancouver new zealand iraq
soon my crazy idea didn 't seem so crazy
postsecret.com is the most visited advertisement-free blog in the world
and this is my postcard collection today
you can see my wife struggling to stack a brick of postcards on a pyramid of over a half-million secrets
what i 'd like to do now is share with you a very special handful of secrets from that collection starting with this one
i found these stamps as a child and i have been waiting all my life to have someone to send them to
i never did have someone
secrets can take many forms
they can be shocking or silly or soulful
they can connect us to our deepest humanity or with people we 'll never meet
maybe one of you sent this one in
i don 't know
this one does a great job of demonstrating the creativity that people have when they make and mail me a postcard
this one obviously was made out of half a starbucks cup with a stamp and my home address written on the other side
dear birthmother i have great parents
i 've found love i 'm happy
secrets can remind us of the countless human dramas of frailty and heroism playing out silently in the lives of people all around us even now
everyone who knew me before 9 11 believes i 'm dead
i used to work with a bunch of uptight religious people so sometimes i didn 't wear panties and just had a big smile and chuckled to myself
this next one takes a little explanation before i share it with you
i love to speak on college campuses and share secrets and the stories with students
and sometimes afterwards i 'll stick around and sign books and take photos with students
and this next postcard was made out of one of those photos
and i should also mention that just like today at that postsecret event i was using a wireless microphone
your mic wasn 't off during sound check
we all heard you pee
this was really embarrassing when it happened until i realized it could have been worse
right you know what i 'm saying
inside this envelope is the ripped up remains of a suicide note i didn 't use
i feel like the happiest person on earth one of these men is the father of my son
he pays me a lot to keep it a secret
that saturday when you wondered where i was well i was getting your ring
it 's in my pocket right now
i had this postcard posted on the postsecret blog two years ago on valentine 's day
it was the very bottom the last secret in the long column
and it hadn 't been up for more than a couple hours before i received this exuberant email from the guy who mailed me this postcard
and he said frank i 've got to share with you this story that just played out in my life
he said my knees are still shaking
he said for three years my girlfriend and i we 've made it this sunday morning ritual to visit the postsecret blog together and read the secrets out loud
i read some to her she reads some to me
he says it 's really brought us closer together through the years
and so when i discovered that you had posted my surprise proposal to my girlfriend at the very bottom i was beside myself
and i tried to act calm not to give anything away
and just like every sunday we started reading the secrets out loud to each other
he said but this time it seemed like it was taking her forever to get through each one
but she finally did
she got to that bottom secret his proposal to her
and he said she read it once and then she read it again
and she turned to him and said is that our cat
and when she saw him he was down on one knee he had the ring out
he popped the question she said yes it was a very happy ending
so i emailed him back and i said please share with me an image something that i can share with the whole postsecret community and let everyone know your fairy tale ending
and he emailed me this picture
i found your camera at lollapalooza this summer
i finally got the pictures developed and i 'd love to give them to you
this picture never got returned back to the people who lost it but this secret has impacted many lives starting with a student up in canada named matty
matty was inspired by that secret to start his own website a website called ifoundyourcamera
matty invites people to mail him digital cameras that they 've found memory sticks that have been lost with orphan photos
and matty takes the pictures off these cameras and posts them on his website every week
and people come to visit to see if they can identify a picture they 've lost or help somebody else get the photos back to them that they might be desperately searching for
this one 's my favorite
matty has found this ingenious way to leverage the kindness of strangers
and it might seem like a simple idea and it is but the impact it can have on people 's lives can be huge
matty shared with me an emotional email he received from the mother in that picture
that 's me my husband and son
the other pictures are of my very ill grandmother
thank you for making your site
these pictures mean more to me than you know
my son 's birth is on this camera
he turns four tomorrow
every picture that you see there and thousands of others have been returned back to the person who lost it sometimes crossing oceans sometimes going through language barriers
this is the last postcard i have to share with you today
when people i love leave voicemails on my phone i always save them in case they die tomorrow and i have no other way of hearing their voice ever again
when i posted this secret dozens of people sent voicemail messages from their phones sometimes ones they 'd been keeping for years messages from family or friends who had died
they said that by preserving those voices and sharing them it helped them keep the spirit of their loved ones alive
one young girl posted the last message she ever heard from her grandmother
secrets can take many forms
they can be shocking or silly or soulful
they can connect us with our deepest humanity or with people we 'll never meet again
voicemail recording first saved voice message
it 's somebody 's birthday today somebody 's birthday today the candles are lighted on somebody 's cake and we 're all invited for somebody 's sake you 're 21 years old today
have a real happy birthday and i love you
i 'll say bye for now
thank you
thank you
frank that was beautiful so touching
have you ever sent yourself a postcard
have you ever sent in a secret to postsecret
i have one of my own secrets in every book
i think in some ways the reason i started the project even though i didn 't know it at the time was because i was struggling with my own secrets
and it was through crowd-sourcing it was through the kindness that strangers were showing me that i could uncover parts of my past that were haunting me
and has anyone ever discovered which secret was yours in the book
has anyone in your life been able to tell
sometimes i share that information yeah
i grew up in new york city between harlem and the bronx
growing up as a boy we were taught that men had to be tough had to be strong had to be courageous dominating no pain no emotions with the exception of anger and definitely no fear that men are in charge which means women are not that men lead and you should just follow and do what we say that men are superior women are inferior that men are strong women are weak that women are of less value property of men and objects particularly sexual objects
i 've later come to know that to be the collective socialization of men better known as the man box
see this man box has in it all the ingredients of how we define what it means to be a man
now i also want to say without a doubt there are some wonderful wonderful absolutely wonderful things about being a man
but at the same time there 's some stuff that 's just straight up twisted and we really need to begin to challenge look at it and really get in the process of deconstructing redefining what we come to know as manhood
this is my two at home kendall and jay
they 're 11 and 12
kendall 's 15 months older than jay
there was a period of time when my wife her name is tammie and i we just got real busy and whip bam boom kendall and jay
and when they were about five and six four and five jay could come to me come to me crying
it didn 't matter what she was crying about she could get on my knee she could snot my sleeve up just cry cry it out
daddy 's got you that 's all that 's important
now kendall on the other hand and like i said he 's only 15 months older than her he 'd come to me crying it 's like as soon as i would hear him cry a clock would go off
i would give the boy probably about 30 seconds which means by the time he got to me i was already saying things like why are you crying
hold your head up look at me
explain to me what 's wrong
tell me what 's wrong i can 't understand you
why are you crying
and out of my own frustration of my role and responsibility of building him up as a man to fit into these guidelines and these structures that are defining this man box i would find myself saying things like just go in your room
just go on go on in your room
sit down get yourself together and come back and talk to me when you can talk to me like a what
like a man
and he 's five years old
and as i grow in life i would say to myself my god what 's wrong with me
what am i doing why would i do this
and i think back
i think back to my father
there was a time in my life where we had a very troubled experience in our family
my brother henry he died tragically when we were teenagers
we lived in new york city as i said
we lived in the bronx at the time and the burial was in a place called long island it was about two hours outside of the city
and as we were preparing to come back from the burial the cars stopped at the bathroom to let folks take care of themselves before the long ride back to the city
and the limousine empties out
my mother my sister my auntie they all get out but my father and i stayed in the limousine and no sooner than the women got out he burst out crying
he didn 't want cry in front of me but he knew he wasn 't going to make it back to the city and it was better me than to allow himself to express these feelings and emotions in front of the women
and this is a man who 10 minutes ago had just put his teenage son in the ground something i just can 't even imagine
the thing that sticks with me the most is that he was apologizing to me for crying in front of me and at the same time he was also giving me props lifting me up for not crying
i come to also look at this as this fear that we have as men this fear that just has us paralyzed holding us hostage to this man box
i can remember speaking to a 12-year-old boy a football player and i asked him i said how would you feel if in front of all the players your coach told you you were playing like a girl
now i expected him to say something like i 'd be sad i 'd be mad i 'd be angry or something like that
no the boy said to me the boy said to me it would destroy me
and i said to myself god if it would destroy him to be called a girl what are we then teaching him about girls
it took me back to a time when i was about 12 years old
i grew up in tenement buildings in the inner city
at this time we 're living in the bronx and in the building next to where i lived there was a guy named johnny
he was about 16 years old and we were all about 12 years old younger guys
and he was hanging out with all us younger guys
and this guy he was up to a lot of no good
he was the kind of kid who parents would have to wonder what is this 16-year-old boy doing with these 12-year-old boys
and he did spend a lot of time up to no good
he was a troubled kid
his mother had died from a heroin overdose
he was being raised by his grandmother
his father wasn 't on the set
his grandmother had two jobs
he was home alone a lot
but i 've got to tell you we young guys we looked up to this dude man
he was cool he was fine
that 's what the sisters said he was fine
he was having sex
we all looked up to him
so one day i 'm out in front of the house doing something just playing around doing something i don 't know what
he looks out his window he calls me upstairs he said hey anthony
they called me anthony growing up as a kid
hey anthony come on upstairs
johnny call you go
so i run right upstairs
as he opens the door he says to me do you want some
now i immediately knew what he meant
because for me growing up at that time and our relationship with this man box do you want some meant one of two things sex or drugs and we weren 't doing drugs
now my box my card my man box card was immediately in jeopardy
two things one i never had sex
we don 't talk about that as men
you only tell your dearest closest friend sworn to secrecy for life the first time you had sex
for everybody else we go around like we 've been having sex since we were two
there ain 't no first time
the other thing i couldn 't tell him is that i didn 't want any
that 's even worse we 're supposed to always be on the prowl
women are objects especially sexual objects
anyway so i couldn 't tell him any of that
so like my mother would say make a long story short i just simply said to johnny yes
he told me to go in his room
i go in his room on his bed is a girl from the neighborhood named sheila
she 's 16 years old
she 's nude
she 's what i know today to be mentally ill higher-functioning at times than others
we had a whole choice of inappropriate names for her
anyway johnny had just gotten through having sex with her
well actually he raped her but he would say he had sex with her
because while sheila never said no she also never said yes
so he was offering me the opportunity to do the same
so when i go in the room i close the door
folks i 'm petrified
i stand with my back to the door so johnny can 't bust in the room and see that i 'm not doing anything and i stand there long enough that i could have actually done something
so now i 'm no longer trying to figure out what i 'm going to do i 'm trying to figure out how i 'm going to get out of this room
so in my 12 years of wisdom i zip my pants down i walk out into the room and lo and behold to me while i was in the room with sheila johnny was back at the window calling guys up
so now there 's a living room full of guys
it was like the waiting room in the doctor 's office
and they asked me how was it and i say to them it was good and i zip my pants up in front of them and i head for the door
now i say this all with remorse and i was feeling a tremendous amount of remorse at that time but i was conflicted because while i was feeling remorse i was excited because i didn 't get caught
but i knew i felt bad about what was happening
this fear getting outside the man box totally enveloped me
it was way more important to me about me and my man box card than about sheila and what was happening to her
see collectively we as men are taught to have less value in women to view them as property and the objects of men
we see that as an equation that equals violence against women
we as men good men the large majority of men we operate on the foundation of this whole collective socialization
we kind of see ourselves separate but we 're very much a part of it
you see we have to come to understand that less value property and objectification is the foundation and the violence can 't happen without it
so we 're very much a part of the solution as well as the problem
the center for disease control says that men 's violence against women is at epidemic proportions is the number one health concern for women in this country and abroad
so quickly i 'd like to just say this is the love of my life my daughter jay
the world i envision for her how do i want men to be acting and behaving
i need you on board i need you with me
i need you working with me and me working with you on how we raise our sons and teach them to be men that it 's okay to not be dominating that it 's okay to have feelings and emotions that it 's okay to promote equality that it 's okay to have women who are just friends and that 's it that it 's okay to be whole that my liberation as a man is tied to your liberation as a woman
i remember asking a nine-year-old boy i asked a nine-year-old boy what would life be like for you if you didn 't have to adhere to this man box
he said to me i would be free
thank you folks
ten years ago on a tuesday morning i conducted a parachute jump at fort bragg north carolina
it was a routine training jump like many more i 'd done since i became a paratrooper 27 years before
we went down to the airfield early because this is the army and you always go early
you do some routine refresher training and then you go to put on your parachute and a buddy helps you
and you put on the t-10 parachute
and you 're very careful how you put the straps particularly the leg straps because they go between your legs
and then you put on your reserve and then you put on your heavy rucksack
and then a jumpmaster comes and he 's an experienced nco in parachute operations
he checks you out he grabs your adjusting straps and he tightens everything so that your chest is crushed your shoulders are crushed down and of course he 's tightened so your voice goes up a couple octaves as well
then you sit down and you wait a little while because this is the army
then you load the aircraft and then you stand up and you get on and you kind of lumber to the aircraft like this in a line of people and you sit down on canvas seats on either side of the aircraft
and you wait a little bit longer because this is the air force teaching the army how to wait
then you take off
and it 's painful enough now and i think it 's designed this way it 's painful enough so you want to jump
you didn 't really want to jump but you want out
so you get in the aircraft you 're flying along and at 20 minutes out these jumpmasters start giving you commands
they give 20 minutes that 's a time warning
you sit there ok
then they give you 10 minutes
and of course you 're responding with all of these
and that 's to boost everybody 's confidence to show that you 're not scared
then they give you get ready
then they go outboard personnel stand up
if you 're an outboard personnel now you stand up
if you 're an inboard personnel stand up
and then you hook up and you hook up your static line
and at that point you think hey guess what
i 'm probably going to jump
there 's no way to get out of this at this point
you go through some additional checks and then they open the door
and this was that tuesday morning in september and it was pretty nice outside
so nice air comes flowing in
the jumpmasters start to check the door
and then when it 's time to go a green light goes and the jumpmaster goes go
the first guy goes and you 're just in line and you just kind of lumber to the door
jump is a misnomer you fall
you fall outside the door you 're caught in the slipstream
the first thing you do is lock into a tight body position head down in your chest your arms extended put over your reserve parachute
you do that because 27 years before an airborne sergeant had taught me to do that
i have no idea whether it makes any difference but he seemed to make sense and i wasn 't going to test the hypothesis that he 'd be wrong
and then you wait for the opening shock for your parachute to open
if you don 't get an opening shock you don 't get a parachute you 've got a whole new problem set
but typically you do typically it opens
and of course if your leg straps aren 't set right at that point you get another little thrill
boom
so then you look around you 're under a canopy and you say this is good
now you prepare for the inevitable
you are going to hit the ground
you can 't delay that much
and you really can 't decide where you hit very much because they pretend you can steer but you 're being delivered
so you look around where you 're going to land you try to make yourself ready
and then as you get close you lower your rucksack below you on a lowering line so that it 's not on you when you land and you prepare to do a parachute-landing fall
now the army teaches you to do five points of performance the toes of your feet your calves your thighs your buttocks and your push-up muscles
it 's this elegant little land twist and roll
and that 's not going to hurt
in 30-some years of jumping i never did one
i always landed like a watermelon out of a third floor window
and as soon as i hit the first thing i did is i 'd see if i 'd broken anything that i needed
i 'd shake my head and i 'd ask myself the eternal question why didn 't i go into banking
and i 'd look around and then i 'd see another paratrooper a young guy or girl and they 'd have pulled out their m4 carbine and they 'd be picking up their equipment
they 'd be doing everything that we had taught them
and i realized that if they had to go into combat they would do what we had taught them and they would follow leaders
and i realized that if they came out of combat it would be because we led them well
and i was hooked again on the importance of what i did
so now i do that tuesday morning jump but it 's not any jump that was september 11th 2001
and when we took off from the airfield america was at peace
when we landed on the drop-zone everything had changed
and what we thought about the possibility of those young soldiers going into combat as being theoretical was now very very real and leadership seemed important
but things had changed i was a 46-year-old brigadier general
i 'd been successful but things changed so much that i was going to have to make some significant changes and on that morning i didn 't know it
i was raised with traditional stories of leadership robert e. lee john buford at gettysburg
and i also was raised with personal examples of leadership
this was my father in vietnam
and i was raised to believe that soldiers were strong and wise and brave and faithful they didn 't lie cheat steal or abandon their comrades
and i still believe real leaders are like that
but in my first 25 years of career i had a bunch of different experiences
one of my first battalion commanders i worked in his battalion for 18 months and the only conversation he ever had with lt. mcchrystal was at mile 18 of a 25-mile road march and he chewed my ass for about 40 seconds
and i 'm not sure that was real interaction
but then a couple of years later when i was a company commander i went out to the national training center
and we did an operation and my company did a dawn attack you know the classic dawn attack you prepare all night move to the line of departure
and i had an armored organization at that point
we move forward and we get wiped out i mean wiped out immediately
the enemy didn 't break a sweat doing it
and after the battle they bring this mobile theater and they do what they call an after action review to teach you what you 've done wrong
sort of leadership by humiliation
they put a big screen up and they take you through everything and then you didn 't do this and you didn 't do this etc
i walked out feeling as low as a snake 's belly in a wagon rut
and i saw my battalion commander because i had let him down
and i went up to apologize to him and he said stanley i thought you did great
and in one sentence he lifted me put me back on my feet and taught me that leaders can let you fail and yet not let you be a failure
when 9 11 came 46-year-old brig. gen. mcchrystal sees a whole new world
first the things that are obvious that you 're familiar with the environment changed the speed the scrutiny the sensitivity of everything now is so fast sometimes it evolves faster than people have time to really reflect on it
but everything we do is in a different context
more importantly the force that i led was spread over more than 20 countries
and instead of being able to get all the key leaders for a decision together in a single room and look them in the eye and build their confidence and get trust from them i 'm now leading a force that 's dispersed and i 've got to use other techniques
i 've got to use video teleconferences i 've got to use chat i 've got to use email i 've got to use phone calls i 've got to use everything i can not just for communication but for leadership
a 22-year-old individual operating alone thousands of miles from me has got to communicate to me with confidence
i have to have trust in them and vice versa
and i also have to build their faith
and that 's a new kind of leadership for me
we had one operation where we had to coordinate it from multiple locations
an emerging opportunity came didn 't have time to get everybody together
so we had to get complex intelligence together we had to line up the ability to act
it was sensitive we had to go up the chain of command convince them that this was the right thing to do and do all of this on electronic medium
we failed
the mission didn 't work
and so now what we had to do is i had to reach out to try to rebuild the trust of that force rebuild their confidence me and them and them and me and our seniors and us as a force all without the ability to put a hand on a shoulder
entirely new requirement
also the people had changed
you probably think that the force that i led was all steely-eyed commandos with big knuckle fists carrying exotic weapons
in reality much of the force i led looked exactly like you
it was men women young old not just from military from different organizations many of them detailed to us just from a handshake
and so instead of giving orders you 're now building consensus and you 're building a sense of shared purpose
probably the biggest change was understanding that the generational difference the ages had changed so much
i went down to be with a ranger platoon on an operation in afghanistan and on that operation a sergeant in the platoon had lost about half his arm throwing a taliban hand grenade back at the enemy after it had landed in his fire team
we talked about the operation and then at the end i did what i often do with a force like that
i asked where were you on 9 11
and one young ranger in the back his hair 's tousled and his face is red and windblown from being in combat in the cold afghan wind he said sir i was in the sixth grade
and it reminded me that we 're operating a force that must have shared purpose and shared consciousness and yet he has different experiences in many cases a different vocabulary a completely different skill set in terms of digital media than i do and many of the other senior leaders
and yet we need to have that shared sense
it also produced something which i call an inversion of expertise because we had so many changes at the lower levels in technology and tactics and whatnot that suddenly the things that we grew up doing wasn 't what the force was doing anymore
so how does a leader stay credible and legitimate when they haven 't done what the people you 're leading are doing
and it 's a brand new leadership challenge
and it forced me to become a lot more transparent a lot more willing to listen a lot more willing to be reverse-mentored from lower
and yet again you 're not all in one room
then another thing
there 's an effect on you and on your leaders
there 's an impact it 's cumulative
you don 't reset or recharge your battery every time
i stood in front of a screen one night in iraq with one of my senior officers and we watched a firefight from one of our forces
and i remembered his son was in our force
and i said john where 's your son and how is he
and he said sir he 's fine thanks for asking
i said where is he now
and he pointed at the screen he said he 's in that firefight
think about watching your brother father daughter son wife in a firefight in real time and you can 't do anything about it
think about knowing that over time
and it 's a new cumulative pressure on leaders
and you have to watch and take care of each other
i probably learned the most about relationships
i learned they are the sinew which hold the force together
i grew up much of my career in the ranger regiment
and every morning in the ranger regiment every ranger and there are more than 2,000 of them says a six-stanza ranger creed
you may know one line of it it says i 'll never leave a fallen comrade to fall into the hands of the enemy
and it 's not a mindless mantra and it 's not a poem
it 's a promise
every ranger promises every other ranger no matter what happens no matter what it costs me if you need me i 'm coming
and every ranger gets that same promise from every other ranger
think about it it 's extraordinarily powerful
it 's probably more powerful than marriage vows
and they 've lived up to it which gives it special power
and so the organizational relationship that bonds them is just amazing
and i learned personal relationships were more important than ever
we were in a difficult operation in afghanistan in 2007 and an old friend of mine that i had spent many years at various points of my career with godfather to one of their kids he sent me a note just in an envelope that had a quote from sherman to grant that said i knew if i ever got in a tight spot that you would come if alive
and having that kind of relationship for me turned out to be critical at many points in my career
and i learned that you have to give that in this environment because it 's tough
that was my journey
i hope it 's not over
i came to believe that a leader isn 't good because they 're right they 're good because they 're willing to learn and to trust
this isn 't easy stuff
it 's not like that electronic abs machine where 15 minutes a month you get washboard abs
and it isn 't always fair
you can get knocked down and it hurts and it leaves scars
but if you 're a leader the people you 've counted on will help you up
and if you 're a leader the people who count on you need you on your feet
thank you

so i tried to do a small good thing for my wife
it makes me to stand here the fame the money i got out of it
so what i did i 'd gone back to my early marriage days
what you did in the early marriage days you tried to impress your wife i did the same
on that occasion i found my wife carrying something like this
i saw what is that i asked
my wife replied none of your business
then being her husband i ran behind her and saw she had a nasty rag cloth
i don 't even use that cloth to clean my two-wheeler
then i understood this adapting that unhygienic method to manage her period days
then i immediately asked her why are you [ using ] that unhygienic method
she replied i also know about [ sanitary pads ] but myself and my sisters if they start using that we have to cut our family milk budget
then i was shocked what is the connection between using a sanitary pad and a milk budget
and it 's called affordability
i tried to impress my new wife by offering her a packet of sanitary pads
i went to a local shop i tried to buy her a sanitary pad packet
that fellow looks left and right and spreads a newspaper rolls it into the newspaper gives it to me like a banned item something like that
i don 't know why i did not ask for a condom
then i took that pad i want to see that what is inside it
the very first time at the age of 29 that day i am touching the sanitary pad first ever
i must know how many of the guys here have touched a sanitary pad
they are not going to touch that because it 's not your matter
then i thought to myself white substance made of cotton oh my god that guy is just using a penny value of raw material inside they are selling for pounds dollars
why not make a local sanitary pad for my new wife
that 's how all this started but after making a sanitary pad where can i check it
it 's not like i can just check it in the lab
i need a woman volunteer where can i get one in india
even in bangalore you won 't get [ one ] in india
so only problem the only available victim is my wife
then i made a sanitary pad and handed it to shanti my wife 's name is shanti
close your eyes whatever i give it will be not a diamond pendant not a diamond ring even a chocolate i will give you a surprise with a lot of tinsel paper rolled up with it
close your eyes
because i tried to make it intimate
because it 's an arranged marriage not a love marriage
so one day she said openly i 'm not going to support this research
then other victims they got into my sisters
but even sisters wives they 're not ready to support in the research
that 's why i am always jealous with the saints in india
they are having a lot of women volunteers around them
why i am not getting [ any ]
you know without them even calling they 'll get a lot of women volunteers
then i used tried to use the medical college girls
they also refused finally i decide use sanitary pad myself
now i am having a title like the first man to set foot on the moon
armstrong then tenzing [ and ] hillary in everest like that muruganantham is the first man wore a sanitary pad across the globe
i wore a sanitary pad i filled animal blood in a football bottle i tied it up here there is a tube going into my panties while i 'm walking while i 'm cycling i made a press doses of blood will go there
that makes me bow down to any woman in front of me to give full respect that five days i 'll never forget the messy days the lousy days that wetness
my god it 's unbelievable
but here the problem is one company is making napkin out of cotton it is working well
but i am also trying to make sanitary pad with the good cotton it 's not working
that makes me to want to refuse to continue this research and research and research
you need first funds
not only financial crises but because of the sanitary pad research i come through all sorts of problems including a divorce notice from my wife
why is this i used medical college girls
she suspects i am using as a trump card to run behind medical college girls
finally i came to know it is a special cellulose derived from a pinewood but even after that you need a multimillion-dollar plant like this to process that material again a stop-up
then i spend another four years to create my own machine tools a simple machine tool like this
in this machine any rural woman can apply the same raw materials that they are processing in the multinational plant anyone can make a world-class napkin at your dining hall
that is my invention
so after that what i did usually if anyone got a patent or an invention immediately you want to make convert into this
i never did this i dropped it just like this because you do this if anyone runs after money their life will not [ have ] any beauty it is boredom
a lot of people making a lot of money billion billions of dollars accumulating
why are they coming for finally for philanthropy
why the need for accumulating money then doing philanthropy
what if one decided to start philanthropy from the day one
that 's why i am giving this machine only in rural india for rural women because in india [ you 'll be ] surprised only two percent of women are using sanitary pads the rest they 're using a rag cloth a leaf husk [ saw ] dust everything except sanitary pads
it is the same in the 21st century that 's why i am going to decide to give this machine only for poor women across india
so far 630 installations happened in 23 states in six other countries
now i 'm on my seventh year sustaining against multinational transnational giants makes all mba students a question mark
a school dropout from coimbatore how he is able to sustaining
that makes me a visiting professor and guest lecturer in all iims
play video one
arunachalam muruganantham the thing i saw in my wife 's hand why are you using that nasty cloth
she replied immediately i know about napkins but if i start using napkins then we have to cut our family milk budget
why not make myself a low-cost napkin
so i decided i 'm going to sell this new machine only for women self help groups
that is my idea
am and previously you need a multimillion investment for machine and all now any rural woman can
they are performing puja
you just think competing giants even from harvard oxford is difficult
i make a rural woman to compete with multinationals
i 'm sustaining on seventh year
already 600 installations what is my mission
i 'm going to make india [ into ] a 100-percent-sanitary-napkin-using country in my lifetime
in this way i 'm going to provide not less than a million rural employment that i 'm going to create
that 's why i 'm not running after this bloody money
i 'm doing something serious
if you chase a girl the girl won 't like you
do your job simply the girl will chase you
like that i never chased mahalakshmi
mahalakshmi is chasing me i am keeping in the back pocket
not in front pocket i 'm a back pocket man
that 's all a school dropout saw your problem in the society of not using sanitary pad
i am becoming a solution provider i 'm very happy
i don 't want to make this as a corporate entity
i want to make this as a local sanitary pad movement across the globe that 's why i put all the details on public domain like an open software
now 110 countries are accessing it okay
so i classify the people into three uneducated little educated surplus educated
little educated done this surplus educated what are you going to do for the society
thank you very much bye

there is nothing bigger or older than the universe
the questions i would like to talk about are one where did we come from
how did the universe come into being
are we alone in the universe
is there alien life out there
what is the future of the human race
up until the 1920s everyone thought the universe was essentially static and unchanging in time
then it was discovered that the universe was expanding
distant galaxies were moving away from us
this meant they must have been closer together in the past
if we extrapolate back we find we must have all been on top of each other about 15 billion years ago
this was the big bang the beginning of the universe
but was there anything before the big bang
if not what created the universe
why did the universe emerge from the big bang the way it did
we used to think that the theory of the universe could be divided into two parts
first there were the laws like maxwell 's equations and general relativity that determined the evolution of the universe given its state over all of space at one time
and second there was no question of the initial state of the universe
we have made good progress on the first part and now have the knowledge of the laws of evolution in all but the most extreme conditions
but until recently we have had little idea about the initial conditions for the universe
however this division into laws of evolution and initial conditions depends on time and space being separate and distinct
under extreme conditions general relativity and quantum theory allow time to behave like another dimension of space
this removes the distinction between time and space and means the laws of evolution can also determine the initial state
the universe can spontaneously create itself out of nothing
moreover we can calculate a probability that the universe was created in different states
these predictions are in excellent agreement with observations by the wmap satellite of the cosmic microwave background which is an imprint of the very early universe
we think we have solved the mystery of creation
maybe we should patent the universe and charge everyone royalties for their existence
i now turn to the second big question are we alone or is there other life in the universe
we believe that life arose spontaneously on the earth so it must be possible for life to appear on other suitable planets of which there seem to be a large number in the galaxy
but we don 't know how life first appeared
we have two pieces of observational evidence on the probability of life appearing
the first is that we have fossils of algae from 3.5 billion years ago
the earth was formed 4.6 billion years ago and was probably too hot for about the first half billion years
so life appeared on earth within half a billion years of it being possible which is short compared to the 10-billion-year lifetime of a planet of earth type
this suggests that a probability of life appearing is reasonably high
if it was very low one would have expected it to take most of the ten billion years available
on the other hand we don 't seem to have been visited by aliens
i am discounting the reports of ufos
why would they appear only to cranks and weirdoes
if there is a government conspiracy to suppress the reports and keep for itself the scientific knowledge the aliens bring it seems to have been a singularly ineffective policy so far
furthermore despite an extensive search by the seti project we haven 't heard any alien television quiz shows
this probably indicates that there are no alien civilizations at our stage of development within a radius of a few hundred light years
issuing an insurance policy against abduction by aliens seems a pretty safe bet
this brings me to the last of the big questions the future of the human race
if we are the only intelligent beings in the galaxy we should make sure we survive and continue
but we are entering an increasingly dangerous period of our history
our population and our use of the finite resources of planet earth are growing exponentially along with our technical ability to change the environment for good or ill
but our genetic code still carries the selfish and aggressive instincts that were of survival advantage in the past
it will be difficult enough to avoid disaster in the next hundred years let alone the next thousand or million
our only chance of long-term survival is not to remain lurking on planet earth but to spread out into space
the answers to these big questions show that we have made remarkable progress in the last hundred years
but if we want to continue beyond the next hundred years our future is in space
that is why i am in favor of manned or should i say personed space flight
all of my life i have sought to understand the universe and find answers to these questions
i have been very lucky that my disability has not been a serious handicap
indeed it has probably given me more time than most people to pursue the quest for knowledge
the ultimate goal is a complete theory of the universe and we are making good progress
thank you for listening
professor if you had to guess either way do you now believe that it is more likely than not that we are alone in the milky way as a civilization of our level of intelligence or higher
this answer took seven minutes and really gave me an insight into the incredible act of generosity this whole talk was for ted
stephen hawking i think it quite likely that we are the only civilization within several hundred light years otherwise we would have heard radio waves
the alternative is that civilizations don 't last very long but destroy themselves
professor hawking thank you for that answer
we will take it as a salutary warning i think for the rest of our conference this week
professor we really thank you for the extraordinary effort you made to share your questions with us today
thank you very much indeed
so i 'd like you to come back with me just for a few minutes to a dark night in china the night i met my husband
it was a city so long ago that it was still called peking
so i went to a party
i sat down next to a stout middle-aged man with owl glasses and a bow tie and he turned out to be a fulbright scholar there in china specifically to study sino-soviet relations
what a gift it was to the eager young foreign correspondent that i was then
i 'd pump him for information i 'm mentally scribbling notes for the stories i plan to write
i talk to him for hours
only months later i discover who he really was
he was the china representative for the american soybean association
i don 't understand soybeans
you told me you were a fulbright scholar
well how long would you have talked to me if i told you we 're in soybeans
i said you jerk
only jerk wasn 't the word i used
i said you could 've gotten me fired
and he said let 's get married
travel the world and have lots of kids
so we did
and what an alive man terence bryan foley turned out to be
he was a chinese scholar who later in his 60s got a ph.d. in chinese history
he spoke six languages he played 15 musical instruments he was a licensed pilot he had once been a san francisco cable car operator he was an expert in swine nutrition dairy cattle dixieland jazz film noir and we did travel the country and the world and we did have a lot of kids
we followed my job and it seemed like there was nothing that we couldn 't do
so when we found the cancer it doesn 't seem strange to us at all that without saying a word to each other we believed that if we were smart enough and strong enough and brave enough and we worked hard enough we could keep him from dying ever
and for years it seemed like we were succeeding
the surgeon emerged from the surgery
what 'd he say he said what surgeons always say we got it all
then there was a setback when the pathologists looked at the kidney cancer closely
it turned out to be a rare exceedingly aggressive type with a diagnosis that was almost universally fatal in several weeks at most
and yet he did not die
mysteriously he lived on
he coached little league for our son
he built a playhouse for our daughter
and meanwhile i 'm burying myself in the internet looking for specialists
i 'm looking for a cure
so a year goes by before the cancer as cancers do reappears and with it comes another death sentence this time nine months
so we try another treatment aggressive nasty
it makes him so sick he has to quit it yet still he lives on
then another year goes by
two years go by
more specialists
we take the kids to italy
we take the kids to australia
and then more years pass and the cancer begins to grow
this time there 's new treatments on the horizon
they 're exotic they 're experimental
they 're going to attack the cancer in new ways
so he enters a clinical trial and it works
the cancer begins to shrink and for the third time we 've dodged death
so now i ask you how do i feel when the time finally comes and there 's another dark night sometime between midnight and 2 a.m.
this time it 's on the intensive care ward when a twentysomething resident that i 've never met before tells me that terence is dying perhaps tonight
so what do i say when he says what do you want me to do
there 's another drug out there
it 's newer it 's more powerful
he started it just two weeks ago
perhaps there 's still hope ahead
so what do i say
i say keep him alive if you can
and terence died six days later
so we fought we struggled we triumphed
it was an exhilarating fight and i 'd repeat the fight today without a moment 's hesitation
we fought together we lived together
it turned what could have been seven of the grimmest years of our life into seven of the most glorious
it was also an expensive fight
it was the kind of fight and the kind of choices that everyone here agrees pump up the cost of end-of-life care and of healthcare for all of us
and for me for us we pushed the fight right over the edge and i never got the chance to say to him what i say to him now almost every day hey buddy it was a hell of a ride
we never got the chance to say goodbye
we never thought it was the end
we always had hope
so what do we make of all of this
being a journalist after terence died i wrote a book the cost of hope
i wrote it because i wanted to know why i did what i did why he did what he did why everyone around us did what they did
and what did i discover
well one of the things i discovered is that experts think that one answer to what i did at the end was a piece of paper the advance directive to help families get past the seemingly irrational choices
yet i had that piece of paper
we both did
and they were readily available
i had them right at hand
both of them said the same thing do nothing if there is no further hope
i knew terence 's wishes as clearly and as surely as i knew my own
yet we never got to no further hope
even with that clear-cut paper in our hands we just kept redefining hope
i believed i could keep him from dying and i 'd be embarrassed to say that if i hadn 't seen so many people and have talked to so many people who have felt exactly the same way
right up until days before his death i felt strongly and powerfully and you might say irrationally that i could keep him from dying ever
now what do the experts call this
they say it 's denial
it 's a strong word isn 't it
yet i will tell you that denial isn 't even close to a strong enough word to describe what those of us facing the death of our loved ones go through
and i hear the medical professionals say well we 'd like to do such-and-such but the family 's in denial
the family won 't listen to reason
they 're in denial
how can they insist on this treatment at the end
it 's so clear yet they 're in denial
now i think this maybe isn 't a very useful way of thinking
it 's not just families either
the medical professionals too you out there you 're in denial too
you want to help you want to fix
you want to do
you 've succeeded in everything you 've done and having a patient die well that must feel like failure
i saw it firsthand
just days before terence died his oncologist said tell terence that better days are just ahead
days before he died
yet ira byock the director of palliative medicine at dartmouth said you know the best doctor in the world has never succeeded in making anyone immortal
so what the experts call denial i call hope and i 'd like to borrow a phrase from my friends in software design
you just redefine denial and hope and it becomes a feature of being human
it 's not a bug
it 's a feature
so we need to think more constructively about this very common very profound and very powerful human emotion
it 's part of the human condition and yet our system and our thinking isn 't built to accommodate it
so terence told me a story on that long-ago night and i believed it
maybe i wanted to believe it
and during terence 's illness i we we wanted to believe the story of our fight together too
giving up the fight for that 's how it felt it felt like giving up meant giving up not only his life but also our story our story of us as fighters the story of us as invincible and for the doctors the story of themselves as healers
so what do we need
maybe we don 't need a new piece of paper
maybe we need a new story not a story about giving up the fight or of hopelessness but rather a story of victory and triumph of a valiant battle and eventually a graceful retreat a story that acknowledges that not even the greatest general defeats every foe that no doctor has ever succeeded in making anyone immortal and that no wife no matter how hard she tried has ever stopped even the bravest wittiest and most maddeningly lovable husband from dying when it was his time to go
people did mention hospice but i wouldn 't listen
hospice was for people who were dying and terence wasn 't dying
as a result he spent just four days in hospice which i 'm sure as you all know is a pretty typical outcome and we never said goodbye because we were unprepared for the end
we have a noble path to curing the disease patients and doctors alike but there doesn 't seem to be a noble path to dying
dying is seen as failing and we had a heroic narrative for fighting together but we didn 't have a heroic narrative for letting go
so maybe we need a narrative for acknowledging the end and for saying goodbye and maybe our new story will be about a hero 's fight and a hero 's goodbye
terence loved poetry and the greek poet constantine cavafy is one of my favorite poets
so i 'll give you a couple lines from him
this is a poem about mark antony
you know mark antony the conquering hero cleopatra 's guy
actually one of cleopatra 's guys
and he 's been a pretty good general
he 's won all the fights he 's eluded all the people that are out to get him and yet this time finally he 's come to the city of alexandria and realized he 's lost
the people are leaving they 're playing instruments
they 're singing
and suddenly he knows he 's been defeated
and he suddenly knows he 's been deserted by the gods and it 's time to let go
and the poet tells him what to do
he tells him how to say a noble goodbye a goodbye that 's fit for a hero
as if long-prepared as if courageous as it becomes you who were worthy of such a city approach the window with a firm step and with emotion but not with the entreaties or the complaints of a coward as a last enjoyment listen to the sounds the exquisite instruments of the musical troops and bid her farewell the alexandria you are losing
that 's a goodbye for a man who was larger than life a goodbye for a man for whom anything well almost anything was possible a goodbye for a man who kept hope alive
and isn 't that what we 're missing
how can we learn that people 's decisions about their loved ones are often based strongly powerfully many times irrationally on the slimmest of hopes
the overwhelming presence of hope isn 't denial
it 's part of our dna as humans and maybe it 's time our healthcare system doctors patients insurance companies us started accounting for the power of that hope
hope isn 't a bug
it 's a feature
thank you

you know there 's a small country nestled in the himalayan mountains far from these beautiful mountains where the people of the kingdom of bhutan have decided to do something different which is to measure their gross national happiness rather than their gross national product
and why not
after all happiness is not just a privilege for the lucky few but a fundamental human right for all
and what is happiness
happiness is the freedom of choice
the freedom to chose where to live what to do what to buy what to sell from whom to whom when and how
where does choice come from
and who gets to express it and how do we express it
well one way to express choice is through the market
well-functioning markets provide choices and ultimately the ability to express one 's pursuit for happiness
the great indian economist amartya sen was awarded the nobel prize for demonstrating that famine is not so much about the availability of food supply but rather the ability to acquire or entitle oneself to that food through the market
in 1984 in what can only be considered one of the greatest crimes of humanity nearly one million people died of starvation in my country of birth ethiopia
not because there was not enough food because there was actually a surplus of food in the fertile regions of the south parts of the country but because in the north people could not access or entitle themselves to that food
that was a turning point for my life
most africans today by far are farmers
and most of africa 's farmers are by and large small farmers in terms of land that they operate and very very small farmers in terms of the capital they have at their disposal
african agriculture today is among or is the most under-capitalized in the world
only seven percent of arable land in africa is irrigated compared to 40 percent in asia
african farmers only use some 22 kilograms of fertilizer per hectare compared to 144 in asia
road density is six times greater in asia than it is in rural africa
there are eight times more tractors in latin america and three times more tractors in asia than in africa
the small farmer in africa today lives a life without much choice and therefore without much freedom
his livelihood is predetermined by the conditions of grinding poverty
he comes to the market when prices are lowest with the meager fruits of his hard labor just after the harvest because he has no choice
she comes back to the market some months later when prices are highest in what we call the lean season when food is scarce because she has to feed her family and has no choice
the real question is how can markets be developed in rural africa to harness the power of innovation and entrepreneurship that we know exists
another notable economist theodore schultz in 1974 won the nobel prize for demonstrating that farmers are efficient but poor
meaning in fact that farmers are rational and profit-minded just like everybody else
well we don 't need now any more nobel prizes to know that farmers want a fair shake at the market and want to make money just like everyone else
and one thing is clear which is at least now we know that africa is open for business
and that business is agriculture
over two decades ago the world insisted to africa that markets must be liberalized that economies must be structurally adjusted
this meant that governments were to remove themselves from the business of buying and selling which they did rather inefficiently and let the private market do its magic
well what happened over the last 25 years
did africa feed itself
did our farmers turn into highly productive commercial actors
i think we 're all in this room probably because we know that in fact africa is the only region in the world where hunger and malnutrition are projected to go up over the next 10 years where the food import bill is now double what it was 20 years ago where food production per capita has stagnated and where fertilizer use has declined rather than increased
so why didn 't agriculture markets perform to expectations
the market reforms prompted by the west and i 've spent some 15 years traveling around the continent doing research on agricultural markets and have interviewed traders in 10 to 15 countries in this continent hundreds of traders trying to understand what went wrong with our market reform
and it seems to me that the reforms might have thrown the baby out with the bath water
like its agriculture africa 's markets are highly under-capitalized and inefficient
we know from our work around the continent that transaction costs of reaching the market and the risks of transacting in rural agriculture markets are extremely high
in fact only one third of agricultural output produced in africa even reaches the market
africa 's markets are weak not only because of weak infrastructure in terms of roads and telecommunications but also because of the virtual absence of necessary market institutions such as market information grades and standards and reliable ways to connect buyers and sellers
because of this commodity buyers and sellers typically transact in small circles in narrow networks of people they know and trust
and because of that as grain changes hands and i 've measured that it changes hands four five times in its trajectory from the farmer to the consumer every time it changes hands and i 've seen this all over rural africa it also changes sacks
and i thought that was incredibly peculiar
and really realized that that was because as traders would tell me over and over that 's the only way people know what they 're getting in terms of the quantity and the product quality
and that actually has huge implications for the ability of markets to quickly respond to price signals and situations where there are deficits for example
it also has very high cost implications
i have measured that 26 percent of the marketing margin is simply due to the fact that because of the absence of grades and standards and market information sacks have to be constantly changed
and this leads to very high handling costs
for their part small farmers who produce the bulk of our agricultural output in africa come to the market with virtually no information at all blind trusting that they 're going to have some sort of demand for their produce and completely at the mercy of the merchants in the only market the nearest local market they know where they 're unable to negotiate better prices or reduce their risk
speaking of risk we have seen that price volatility of food crops in africa is the highest in the world
in africa small farmers bear the brunt of this risk
in fact in my view there is no region of the world and no period in history that farmers have been expected to bear the kind of market risk that africa 's farmers have to bear
and in my view there is simply no place in the world that has grown its agriculture on the kind of risk that our farmers in africa today face
in ethiopia for example the variation in maize prices from year to year is as much as 50 percent annually
this kind of market risk is mind-boggling and has direct implications for not only the incentives of farmers to invest in higher productivity technology such as modern seeds and fertilizers but also direct implications for food security
to give you an example between 2001 and 2002 ethiopian maize farmers produced two years of bumper harvest
that in turn because of the weak marketing system led to an 80 percent collapse in maize prices in the country
this made it unprofitable for some farmers to even harvest the grain from the fields
and we calculated that some 300,000 tons of grain was left in the fields to rot in early 2002
not six months later in july 2002 ethiopia announced a major food crisis to the same proportions as 1984 14 million people at risk of starvation
what also happened that year is in the areas where there were good rains and where farmers had previously produced surplus grain farmers had decided to withdraw from the fertilizer market not use fertilizer and actually had dropped their use of fertilizer by 27 percent
this is a tragic example of arrested development or a budding green revolution stopped in its tracks
and this is not just specific to ethiopia but happens over and over all over africa
well i 'm not here today to lament about the situation or wring my hands
i am here to tell you that change is in the air
africa today is not the africa waiting for aid solutions or cookie-cutter foreign expert policy prescriptions
africa has learned or is learning somewhat slowly that markets don 't happen by themselves
in the 1980s it was very fashionable to talk about getting prices right
there was a very influential book about that which was mainly about getting governments out of the market
we now recognize that getting markets right is about not just price incentives but also investing in the right infrastructure and the appropriate and necessary institutions to create the conditions to unleash the power of innovation in the market
when conditions are right we know and see that that innovation is ready to explode in rural africa just like anywhere else
nearly three years ago i decided to leave my comfortable job as a world bank senior economist in washington and come back to my country of birth ethiopia after nearly 30 years abroad
i did so for a simple reason
after having spent more than a decade understanding studying and trying to convince policymakers and donors about what was wrong with africa 's agricultural markets i decided it was time to do something about it
i currently lead in ethiopia an exciting new initiative to establish the first ethiopia commodity exchange or ecx
now the commodity exchange itself that concept is not new to the world
in fact in 1848 82 grain merchants and farmers got together in a small town at the crossroads of the illinois river and lake michigan to establish a way to trade better amongst themselves
that was of course the birth of the chicago board of trade which is the most famous commodity exchange in the world
the chicago board of trade was established then for precisely the same reasons that our farmers today would benefit from a commodity exchange
in the american midwest farmers used to load grain onto barges and send it upriver to the chicago market
but once it arrived if no buyer was to be found or if prices suddenly dropped farmers would incur tremendous losses
and in fact would even dump the grain in lake michigan rather than spend more money transporting it back to their farms
well the need to avoid these huge risks and tremendous losses led to the birth of the futures market and the underlying system of grading grain and receipting issuing warehouse receipts on the basis of which trade could be done
from there the greatest innovation of all came about in this market which is that buyers and sellers could transact grain without actually having to physically or visually inspect the grain
that meant that grain could be traded across tremendous distances and even across time as far forward as 18 months into the future
this innovation is at the heart of the transformation of american agriculture and the rise of chicago to a global market agricultural market superpower from where it was a small regional town
now over the last century we tend to think of commodity exchanges as the purview of western industrialized countries and that the reference prices for cotton coffee cocoa products produced mainly in the south are actually a reference price or a price discovered in these organized commodity exchanges in the northern countries
but that is actually changing
and we 're seeing a shift powered mainly because of information technology a shift in market dominance towards the emerging markets
and over the last decade you see that the share of western exchanges and this is the u.s. share of exchanges in the world has gone down by nearly half in just the last decade
similarly there 's been explosive growth in india for example where rural farmers are using exchanges growing here over the last three years by 270 percent a year
this is powered by low-cost vsat technology aggressively trying to reach farmers to bring them into the market
china 's dalian commodity exchange three years ago 2004 overtook the chicago board of trade to become the second largest commodity exchange in the world
now in ethiopia we 're in the process of designing the first organized ethiopia commodity exchange
we 're not trying to cut and paste the chicago model or the india model but creating a system uniquely tailored to ethiopia 's needs and realities ethiopia 's small farmers
so the ecx is an ethiopian exchange for ethiopia
we 're creating a system that serves all market actors that creates integrity trust efficiency transparency and enables small farmers to manage the risks that i have described
in the design of our commodity exchange in ethiopia we 've done something rather unique which is to take the approach of an integrated perspective or what we call the ecx edge
the ecx edge pretty much creates the entire ecosystem in which the market will develop itself
and this is because one of the things we 've learned over the last decade of studying market development in africa is that the piecemeal approach does not work
you 've got one donor trying to develop market information another trying to work on or sponsor grades and standards another ict and yet another on warehousing or warehouse receipts
in our approach in ethiopia we 've decided to put together the entire ecosystem or environment in which trade takes place
that means that the exchange will operate a trading system which will initially start as an open outcry because we don 't think the country 's ready for full electronic trading
but at the same time we 'll do something which i think no exchange in the world has ever done which is itself to operate something like an internet cafe in the rural areas
so that farmers and small traders can actually come to a terminal center what we call the remote access terminal centers and actually without having to buy a computer or figure out how to dial up or any of those things simply see the trading that 's happening on the addis ababa trading floor
at the same time what 's very fundamental to this market is that and again an innovation that we 've designed for our exchange is that the exchange will operate warehouses around the country in which grade certification and warehouse receipting will be done
and in turn we 'll operate an in-house clearing system to assure that payment is done appropriately in the right amount and at the right time so that basically we create trust and integrity in the system
obviously we work with exchange actors and as we 're developing the exchange market itself we 're also developing the regulatory infrastructure and legal framework the overarching legal framework for making this market work
so in fact our proclamation is going to parliament next month
what 's really important is that the ecx will operate a market information system to disseminate prices in real time to farmers around the country using vsat technology to bring an electronic price dissemination directly to farmers
what this does is transforms fundamentally the farmers relationship to the market
whereas before the farmer used to think local meaning that he or she would go to the nearest local market eight to 10 kilometers away on average and sell whatever they happened to have without any idea of what the price premium or anything else was now farmers come with knowledge of what prices are at the national market
and they start to think national and even global
they start to make not only commercial marketing decisions but also planting decisions on the basis of information coming from the futures price market
and they come to the market knowing what grades their products will achieve in terms of a price premium
so all of this will transform farmers
it will also transform the way traders do business
it will stop them from doing simple back-to-back limited arbitrage to really thinking strategically about how to move grain across long distances from [ surplus regions ] to [ deficit areas ]
can ethiopia do this
it seems very ambitious
but it will create new opportunities
we believe that this initiative requires great political will and we 'll have to align the financial sector as well as the ict sector and really even the underlying legal framework
we believe that the winds of change are here and that we can do it
ecx is the market for ethiopia 's new millennium which starts in about eight months
the last parliament of our century opened with our president announcing to the country that this was the most important economic initiative for the country today
we believe that the stakes are high but that the returns will be even greater
ecx moreover can become a trading platform for a pan-african market in agricultural commodities
ethiopia 's domestic market is about one billion dollars of value
and we feel that over the next five years if ethiopia can capture even 40 percent just 40 percent of the domestic market and add just 25 percent value to that market the value of the market doubles
ethiopia 's agricultural market is 30 percent higher than south africa 's grain production and in fact ethiopia is the second largest maize producer in africa
so the potential is there
the will is there
the commitment is there
so we feel that we have a winning value proposition to transform farmers choices to grow our agriculture and to change africa
so we are in the business of finding our happiness
thank you very much
when i was seven years old and my sister was just five years old we were playing on top of a bunk bed
i was two years older than my sister at the time i mean i 'm two years older than her now but at the time it meant she had to do everything that i wanted to do and i wanted to play war
so we were up on top of our bunk beds
and on one side of the bunk bed i had put out all of my g.i. joe soldiers and weaponry
and on the other side were all my sister 's my little ponies ready for a cavalry charge
there are differing accounts of what actually happened that afternoon but since my sister is not here with us today let me tell you the true story which is my sister 's a little bit on the clumsy side
somehow without any help or push from her older brother at all suddenly amy disappeared off of the top of the bunk bed and landed with this crash on the floor
now i nervously peered over the side of the bed to see what had befallen my fallen sister and saw that she had landed painfully on her hands and knees on all fours on the ground
i was nervous because my parents had charged me with making sure that my sister and i played as safely and as quietly as possible
and seeing as how i had accidentally broken amy 's arm just one week before ...
... heroically pushing her out of the way of an oncoming imaginary sniper bullet for which i have yet to be thanked i was trying as hard as i could she didn 't even see it coming i was trying as hard as i could to be on my best behavior
and i saw my sister 's face this wail of pain and suffering and surprise threatening to erupt from her mouth and threatening to wake my parents from the long winter 's nap for which they had settled
so i did the only thing my little frantic seven year-old brain could think to do to avert this tragedy
and if you have children you 've seen this hundreds of times before
i said amy amy wait don 't cry don 't cry
did you see how you landed
no human lands on all fours like that
amy i think this means you 're a unicorn
now that was cheating because there was nothing in the world my sister would want more than not to be amy the hurt five year-old little sister but amy the special unicorn
of course this was an option that was open to her brain at no point in the past
and you could see how my poor manipulated sister faced conflict as her little brain attempted to devote resources to feeling the pain and suffering and surprise she just experienced or contemplating her new-found identity as a unicorn
and the latter won out
instead of crying instead of ceasing our play instead of waking my parents with all the negative consequences that would have ensued for me instead a smile spread across her face and she scrambled right back up onto the bunk bed with all the grace of a baby unicorn ...
... with one broken leg
what we stumbled across at this tender age of just five and seven we had no idea at the time was something that was going be at the vanguard of a scientific revolution occurring two decades later in the way that we look at the human brain
what we had stumbled across is something called positive psychology which is the reason that i 'm here today and the reason that i wake up every morning
when i first started talking about this research outside of academia out with companies and schools the very first thing they said to never do is to start your talk with a graph
the very first thing i want to do is start my talk with a graph
this graph looks boring but this graph is the reason i get excited and wake up every morning
and this graph doesn 't even mean anything it 's fake data
what we found is if i got this data back studying you here in the room i would be thrilled because there 's very clearly a trend that 's going on there and that means that i can get published which is all that really matters
the fact that there 's one weird red dot that 's up above the curve there 's one weirdo in the room i know who you are i saw you earlier that 's no problem
that 's no problem as most of you know because i can just delete that dot
i can delete that dot because that 's clearly a measurement error
and we know that 's a measurement error because it 's messing up my data
so one of the very first things we teach people in economics and statistics and business and psychology courses is how in a statistically valid way do we eliminate the weirdos
how do we eliminate the outliers so we can find the line of best fit
which is fantastic if i 'm trying to find out how many advil the average person should be taking two
but if i 'm interested in potential if i 'm interested in your potential or for happiness or productivity or energy or creativity what we 're doing is we 're creating the cult of the average with science
if i asked a question like how fast can a child learn how to read in a classroom
scientists change the answer to how fast does the average child learn how to read in that classroom
and then we tailor the class right towards the average
now if you fall below the average on this curve then psychologists get thrilled because that means you 're either depressed or you have a disorder or hopefully both
we 're hoping for both because our business model is if you come into a therapy session with one problem we want to make sure you leave knowing you have 10 so you keep coming back over and over again
we 'll go back into your childhood if necessary but eventually what we want to do is make you normal again
but normal is merely average
and what i posit and what positive psychology posits is that if we study what is merely average we will remain merely average
then instead of deleting those positive outliers what i intentionally do is come into a population like this one and say why
why is it that some of you are so high above the curve in terms of your intellectual ability athletic ability musical ability creativity energy levels your resiliency in the face of challenge your sense of humor
whatever it is instead of deleting you what i want to do is study you
because maybe we can glean information not just how to move people up to the average but how we can move the entire average up in our companies and schools worldwide
the reason this graph is important to me is when i turn on the news it seems like the majority of the information is not positive in fact it 's negative
most of it 's about murder corruption diseases natural disasters
and very quickly my brain starts to think that 's the accurate ratio of negative to positive in the world
what that 's doing is creating something called the medical school syndrome which if you know people who 've been to medical school during the first year of medical training as you read through a list of all the symptoms and diseases that could happen suddenly you realize you have all of them
i have a brother in-law named bobo which is a whole other story
bobo married amy the unicorn
bobo called me on the phone from yale medical school and bobo said shawn i have leprosy
which even at yale is extraordinarily rare
but i had no idea how to console poor bobo because he had just gotten over an entire week of menopause
see what we 're finding is it 's not necessarily the reality that shapes us but the lens through which your brain views the world that shapes your reality
and if we can change the lens not only can we change your happiness we can change every single educational and business outcome at the same time
when i applied to harvard i applied on a dare
i didn 't expect to get in and my family had no money for college
when i got a military scholarship two weeks later they allowed me to go
suddenly something that wasn 't even a possibility became a reality
when i went there i assumed everyone else would see it as a privilege as well that they 'd be excited to be there
even if you 're in a classroom full of people smarter than you you 'd be happy just to be in that classroom which is what i felt
but what i found there is while some people experience that when i graduated after my four years and then spent the next eight years living in the dorms with the students harvard asked me to i wasn 't that guy
i was an officer of harvard to counsel students through the difficult four years
and what i found in my research and my teaching is that these students no matter how happy they were with their original success of getting into the school two weeks later their brains were focused not on the privilege of being there nor on their philosophy or their physics
their brain was focused on the competition the workload the hassles the stresses the complaints
when i first went in there i walked into the freshmen dining hall which is where my friends from waco texas which is where i grew up i know some of you have heard of it
when they 'd come to visit me they 'd look around they 'd say this freshman dining hall looks like something out of hogwart 's from the movie harry potter which it does
this is hogwart 's from the movie harry potter and that 's harvard
and when they see this they say shawn why do you waste your time studying happiness at harvard
seriously what does a harvard student possibly have to be unhappy about
embedded within that question is the key to understanding the science of happiness
because what that question assumes is that our external world is predictive of our happiness levels when in reality if i know everything about your external world i can only predict 10 percent of your long-term happiness
90 percent of your long-term happiness is predicted not by the external world but by the way your brain processes the world
and if we change it if we change our formula for happiness and success what we can do is change the way that we can then affect reality
what we found is that only 25 percent of job successes are predicted by i.q.
75 percent of job successes are predicted by your optimism levels your social support and your ability to see stress as a challenge instead of as a threat
i talked to a boarding school up in new england probably the most prestigious boarding school and they said we already know that
so every year instead of just teaching our students we also have a wellness week
and we 're so excited monday night we have the world 's leading expert coming in to speak about adolescent depression
tuesday night it 's school violence and bullying
wednesday night is eating disorders
thursday night is elicit drug use
and friday night we 're trying to decide between risky sex or happiness
i said that 's most people 's friday nights
which i 'm glad you liked but they did not like that at all
silence on the phone
and into the silence i said i 'd be happy to speak at your school but just so you know that 's not a wellness week that 's a sickness week
what you 've done is you 've outlined all the negative things that can happen but not talked about the positive
the absence of disease is not health
here 's how we get to health we need to reverse the formula for happiness and success
in the last three years i 've traveled to 45 different countries working with schools and companies in the midst of an economic downturn
and what i found is that most companies and schools follow a formula for success which is this if i work harder i 'll be more successful
and if i 'm more successful then i 'll be happier
that undergirds most of our parenting styles our managing styles the way that we motivate our behavior
and the problem is it 's scientifically broken and backwards for two reasons
first every time your brain has a success you just changed the goalpost of what success looked like
you got good grades now you have to get better grades you got into a good school and after you get into a better school you got a good job now you have to get a better job you hit your sales target we 're going to change your sales target
and if happiness is on the opposite side of success your brain never gets there
what we 've done is we 've pushed happiness over the cognitive horizon as a society
and that 's because we think we have to be successful then we 'll be happier
but the real problem is our brains work in the opposite order
if you can raise somebody 's level of positivity in the present then their brain experiences what we now call a happiness advantage which is your brain at positive performs significantly better than it does at negative neutral or stressed
your intelligence rises your creativity rises your energy levels rise
in fact what we 've found is that every single business outcome improves
your brain at positive is 31 percent more productive than your brain at negative neutral or stressed
you 're 37 percent better at sales
doctors are 19 percent faster more accurate at coming up with the correct diagnosis when positive instead of negative neutral or stressed
which means we can reverse the formula
if we can find a way of becoming positive in the present then our brains work even more successfully as we 're able to work harder faster and more intelligently
what we need to be able to do is to reverse this formula so we can start to see what our brains are actually capable of
because dopamine which floods into your system when you 're positive has two functions
not only does it make you happier it turns on all of the learning centers in your brain allowing you to adapt to the world in a different way
we 've found that there are ways that you can train your brain to be able to become more positive
in just a two-minute span of time done for 21 days in a row we can actually rewire your brain allowing your brain to actually work more optimistically and more successfully
we 've done these things in research now in every single company that i 've worked with getting them to write down three new things that they 're grateful for for 21 days in a row three new things each day
and at the end of that their brain starts to retain a pattern of scanning the world not for the negative but for the positive first
journaling about one positive experience you 've had over the past 24 hours allows your brain to relive it
exercise teaches your brain that your behavior matters
we find that meditation allows your brain to get over the cultural adhd that we 've been creating by trying to do multiple tasks at once and allows our brains to focus on the task at hand
and finally random acts of kindness are conscious acts of kindness
we get people when they open up their inbox to write one positive email praising or thanking somebody in their social support network
and by doing these activities and by training your brain just like we train our bodies what we 've found is we can reverse the formula for happiness and success and in doing so not only create ripples of positivity but create a real revolution
thank you very much
i want to talk a little bit today about labor and work
when we think about how people work the naive intuition we have is that people are like rats in a maze that all people care about is money and the moment we give people money we can direct them to work one way we can direct them to work another way
this is why we give bonuses to bankers and pay in all kinds of ways
and we really have this incredibly simplistic view of why people work and what the labor market looks like
at the same time if you think about it there 's all kinds of strange behaviors in the world around us
think about something like mountaineering and mountain climbing
if you read books of people who climb mountains difficult mountains do you think that those books are full of moments of joy and happiness
no they are full of misery
in fact it 's all about frostbite and difficulty to walk and difficulty of breathing cold challenging circumstances
and if people were just trying to be happy the moment they would get to the top they would say this was a terrible mistake
i 'll never do it again
instead let me sit on a beach somewhere drinking mojitos
but instead people go down and after they recover they go up again
and if you think about mountain climbing as an example it suggests all kinds of things
it suggests that we care about reaching the end a peak
it suggests that we care about the fight about the challenge
it suggests that there 's all kinds of other things that motivate us to work or behave in all kinds of ways
and for me personally i started thinking about this after a student came to visit me
this was a student that was one of my students a few years earlier
and he came one day back to campus
and he told me the following story he said that for more than two weeks he was working on a powerpoint presentation
he was working in a big bank
this was in preparation for a merger and acquisition
and he was working very hard on this presentation graphs tables information
he stayed late at night every day
and the day before it was due he sent his powerpoint presentation to his boss and his boss wrote him back and said nice presentation but the merger is canceled
and the guy was deeply depressed
now at the moment when he was working he was actually quite happy
every night he was enjoying his work he was staying late he was perfecting this powerpoint presentation
but knowing that nobody would ever watch that made him quite depressed
so i started thinking about how do we experiment with this idea of the fruits of our labor
and to start with we created a little experiment in which we gave people legos and we asked them to build with legos
and for some people we gave them legos and we said hey would you like to build this bionicle for three dollars
we 'll pay you three dollars for it
and people said yes and they built with these legos
and when they finished we took it we put it under the table and we said would you like to build another one this time for $ 2.70
if they said yes we gave them another one
and when they finished we asked them do you want to build another one for $ 2.40 $ 2.10 and so on until at some point people said no more it 's not worth it for me
this was what we called the meaningful condition
people built one bionicle after another
after they finished every one of them we put them under the table
and we told them that at the end of the experiment we will take all these bionicles we will disassemble them we will put them back in the boxes and we will use it for the next participant
there was another condition
this other condition was inspired by david my student
and this other condition we called the sisyphic condition
and if you remember the story about sisyphus sisyphus was punished by the gods to push the same rock up a hill and when he almost got to the end the rock would roll over and he would have to start again
and you can think about this as the essence of doing futile work
you can imagine that if he pushed the rock on different hills at least he would have some sense of progress
also if you look at prison movies sometimes the way that the guards torture the prisoners is to get them to dig a hole and when the prisoner is finished they ask him to fill the hole back up and then dig again
there 's something about this cyclical version of doing something over and over and over that seems to be particularly demotivating
so in the second condition of this experiment that 's exactly what we did
we asked people would you like to build one bionicle for three dollars
and if they said yes they built it
then we asked them do you want to build another one for $ 2.70
and if they said yes we gave them a new one and as they were building it we took apart the one that they just finished
and when they finished that we said would you like to build another one this time for 30 cents less
and if they said yes we gave them the one that they built and we broke
so this was an endless cycle of them building and us destroying in front of their eyes
now what happens when you compare these two conditions
the first thing that happened was that people built many more bionicles they built 11 versus seven in the meaningful condition versus the sisyphus condition
and by the way we should point out that this was not a big meaning
people were not curing cancer or building bridges
people were building bionicles for a few cents
and not only that everybody knew that the bionicles would be destroyed quite soon
so there was not a real opportunity for big meaning
but even the small meaning made a difference
now we had another version of this experiment
in this other version of the experiment we didn 't put people in this situation we just described to them the situation much as i am describing to you now and we asked them to predict what the result would be
what happened
people predicted the right direction but not the right magnitude
people who were just given the description of the experiment said that in the meaningful condition people would probably build one more bionicle
so people understand that meaning is important they just don 't understand the magnitude of the importance the extent to which it 's important
there was one other piece of data we looked at
if you think about it there are some people who love legos and some people who don 't
and you would speculate that the people who love legos will build more legos even for less money because after all they get more internal joy from it
and the people who love legos less will build less legos because the enjoyment that they derive from it is lower
and that 's actually what we found in the meaningful condition
there was a very nice correlation between love of lego and the amount of legos people built
what happened in the sisyphic condition
in that condition the correlation was zero
there was no relationship between the love of lego and how much people built which suggests to me that with this manipulation of breaking things in front of people 's eyes we basically crushed any joy that they could get out of this activity
we basically eliminated it
soon after i finished running this experiment i went to talk to a big software company in seattle
i can 't tell you who they were but they were a big company in seattle
and this was a group within this software company that was put in a different building
and they asked them to innovate and create the next big product for this company
and the week before i showed up the ceo of this big software company went to that group 200 engineers and canceled the project
and i stood there in front of 200 of the most depressed people i 've ever talked to
and i described to them some of these lego experiments and they said they felt like they had just been through that experiment
and i asked them i said how many of you now show up to work later than you used to
and everybody raised their hand
i said how many of you now go home earlier than you used to
and everybody raised their hand
i asked them how many of you now add not-so-kosher things to your expense reports
and they didn 't really raise their hands but they took me out to dinner and showed me what they could do with expense reports
and then i asked them i said what could the ceo have done to make you not as depressed
and they came up with all kinds of ideas
they said the ceo could have asked them to present to the whole company about their journey over the last two years and what they decided to do
he could have asked them to think about which aspect of their technology could fit with other parts of the organization
he could have asked them to build some prototypes some next-generation prototypes and seen how they would work
but the thing is that any one of those would require some effort and motivation
and i think the ceo basically did not understand the importance of meaning
if the ceo just like our participants thought the essence of meaning is unimportant then he [ wouldn 't ] care
and he would tell them at the moment i directed you in this way and now that i am directing you in this way everything will be okay
but if you understood how important meaning is then you would figure out that it 's actually important to spend some time energy and effort in getting people to care more about what they 're doing
the next experiment was slightly different
we took a sheet of paper with random letters and we asked people to find pairs of letters that were identical next to each other
that was the task
and people did the first sheet
and then we asked them if they wanted to do the next sheet for a little bit less money and the next sheet for a little bit less money and so on and so forth
and we had three conditions
in the first condition people wrote their name on the sheet found all the pairs of letters gave it to the experimenter
the experimenter would look at it scan it from top to bottom say uh huh and put it on the pile next to them
in the second condition people did not write their name on it
the experimenter looked at it took the sheet of paper did not look at it did not scan it and simply put it on the pile of pages
so you take a piece you just put it on the side
and in the third condition the experimenter got the sheet of paper and directly put it into a shredder
what happened in those three conditions
in this plot i 'm showing you at what pay rate people stopped
so low numbers mean that people worked harder they worked for much longer
in the acknowledged condition people worked all the way down to 15 cents
at 15 cents per page they basically stopped these efforts
in the shredder condition it was twice as much 30 cents per sheet
and this is basically the result we had before
you shred people 's efforts output you get them not to be as happy with what they 're doing
but i should point out by the way that in the shredder condition people could have cheated
they could have done not so good work because they realized that people were just shredding it
so maybe the first sheet you would do good work but then you see nobody is really testing it so you would do more and more and more
so in fact in the shredder condition people could have submitted more work and gotten more money and put less effort into it
but what about the ignored condition
would the ignored condition be more like the acknowledged or more like the shredder or somewhere in the middle
it turns out it was almost like the shredder
now there 's good news and bad news here
the bad news is that ignoring the performance of people is almost as bad as shredding their effort in front of their eyes
ignoring gets you a whole way out there
the good news is that by simply looking at something that somebody has done scanning it and saying uh huh that seems to be quite sufficient to dramatically improve people 's motivations
so the good news is that adding motivation doesn 't seem to be so difficult
the bad news is that eliminating motivations seems to be incredibly easy and if we don 't think about it carefully we might overdo it
so this is all in terms of negative motivation or eliminating negative motivation
the next part i want to show you is something about the positive motivation
so there is a store in the u.s. called ikea
and ikea is a store with kind of okay furniture that takes a long time to assemble
and i don 't know about you but every time i assemble one of those it takes me much longer it 's much more effortful it 's much more confusing
i put things in the wrong way
i can 't say enjoy those pieces
i can 't say i enjoy the process
but when i finish it i seem to like those ikea pieces of furniture more than i like other ones
and there 's an old story about cake mixes
so when they started cake mixes in the 40s they would take this powder and they would put it in a box and they would ask housewives to basically pour it in stir some water in it mix it put it in the oven and voila you had cake
but it turns out they were very unpopular
people did not want them
and they thought about all kinds of reasons for that
maybe the taste was not good
no the taste was great
what they figured out was that there was not enough effort involved
it was so easy that nobody could serve cake to their guests and say here is my cake
no no no it was somebody else 's cake
it was as if you bought it in the store
it didn 't really feel like your own
so what did they do
they took the eggs and the milk out of the powder
now you had to break the eggs and add them
you had to measure the milk and add it mixing it
now it was your cake now everything was fine
now i think a little bit like the ikea effect by getting people to work harder they actually got them to love what they 're doing to a higher degree
so how do we look at this question experimentally
we asked people to build some origami
we gave them instructions on how to create origami and we gave them a sheet of paper
and these were all novices and they built something that was really quite ugly nothing like a frog or a crane
but then we told them we said look this origami really belongs to us
you worked for us but i 'll tell you what we 'll sell it to you
how much do you want to pay for it
and we measured how much they were willing to pay for it
and we had two types of people
we had the people who built it and we had the people who did not build it and just looked at it as external observers
and what we found was that the builders thought that these were beautiful pieces of origami and they were willing to pay for them five times more than the people who just evaluated them externally
now you could say if you were a builder do you think that oh i love this origami but i know that nobody else would love it
or do you think i love this origami and everybody else will love it as well
which one of those two is correct
turns out the builders not only loved the origami more they thought that everybody would see the world in their view
they thought everybody else would love it more as well
in the next version we tried to do the ikea effect
we tried to make it more difficult
so for some people we gave the same task
for some people we made it harder by hiding the instructions
at the top of the sheet we had little diagrams of how do you fold origami
for some people we just eliminated that
so now this was tougher what happened
well in an objective way the origami now was uglier it was more difficult
now when we looked at the easy origami we saw the same thing builders loved it more evaluators loved it less
when you looked at the hard instructions the effect was larger
why because now the builders loved it even more
they put all this extra effort into it
and evaluators they loved it even less
because in reality it was even uglier than the first version
of course this tells you something about how we evaluate things
now think about kids
imagine i asked you how much would you sell your kids for
your memories and associations and so on
most people would say for a lot a lot of money on good days
but imagine this was slightly different
imagine if you did not have your kids and one day you went to the park and you met some kids and they were just like your kids
and you played with them for a few hours
and when you were about to leave the parents said hey by the way just before you leave if you 're interested they 're for sale
how much would you pay for them now
most people say not that much
and this is because our kids are so valuable not just because of who they are but because of us because they are so connected to us and because of the time and connection
and by the way if you think that ikea instructions are not good think about the instructions that come with kids
those are really tough
by the way these are my kids which of course are wonderful and so on
which comes to tell you one more thing which is much like our builders when they look at the creature of their creation we don 't see that other people don 't see things our way
let me say one last comment
if you think about adam smith versus karl marx adam smith had the very important notion of efficiency
he gave an example of a pin factory
he said pins have 12 different steps and if one person does all 12 steps production is very low
but if you get one person to do step one and one person to do step two and step three and so on production can increase tremendously
and indeed this is a great example and the reason for the industrial revolution and efficiency
karl marx on the other hand said that the alienation of labor is incredibly important in how people think about the connection to what they are doing
and if you make all 12 steps you care about the pin
but if you make one step every time maybe you don 't care as much
and i think that in the industrial revolution adam smith was more correct than karl marx but the reality is that we 've switched and now we 're in the knowledge economy
and you can ask yourself what happens in a knowledge economy
is efficiency still more important than meaning
i think the answer is no
i think that as we move to situations in which people have to decide on their own about how much effort attention caring how connected they feel to it are they thinking about labor on the way to work and in the shower and so on all of a sudden marx has more things to say to us
so when we think about labor we usually think about motivation and payment as the same thing but the reality is that we should probably add all kinds of things to it meaning creation challenges ownership identity pride etc
and the good news is that if we added all of those components and thought about them how do we create our own meaning pride motivation and how do we do it in our workplace and for the employees i think we could get people to both be more productive and happier
thank you very much
what i 'd like to start off with is an observation which is that if i 've learned anything over the last year it 's that the supreme irony of publishing a book about slowness is that you have to go around promoting it really fast
i seem to spend most of my time these days zipping from city to city studio to studio interview to interview serving up the book in really tiny bite-size chunks
because everyone these days wants to know how to slow down but they want to know how to slow down really quickly so ...
so i did a spot on cnn the other day where i actually spent more time in makeup than i did talking on air
and i think that that 's not really surprising though is it
because that 's kind of the world that we live in now a world stuck in fast-forward
a world obsessed with speed with doing everything faster with cramming more and more into less and less time
every moment of the day feels like a race against the clock
to borrow a phrase from carrie fisher which is in my bio there i 'll just toss it out again these days even instant gratification takes too long
and if you think about how we to try to make things better what do we do
no we speed them up don 't we so we used to dial now we speed dial
we used to read now we speed read we used to walk now we speed walk
and of course we used to date and now we speed date
and even things that are by their very nature slow we try and speed them up too
so i was in new york recently and i walked past a gym that had an advertisement in the window for a new course a new evening course
and it was for you guessed it speed yoga
so this the perfect solution for time-starved professionals who want to you know salute the sun but only want to give over about 20 minutes to it
i mean these are sort of the extreme examples and they 're amusing and good to laugh at
but there 's a very serious point and i think that in the headlong dash of daily life we often lose sight of the damage that this roadrunner form of living does to us
we 're so marinated in the culture of speed that we almost fail to notice the toll it takes on every aspect of our lives on our health our diet our work our relationships the environment and our community
and sometimes it takes a wake-up call doesn 't it to alert us to the fact that we 're hurrying through our lives instead of actually living them that we 're living the fast life instead of the good life
and i think for many people that wake-up call takes the form of an illness
you know a burnout or eventually the body says i can 't take it anymore and throws in the towel
or maybe a relationship goes up in smoke because we haven 't had the time or the patience or the tranquility to be with the other person to listen to them
and my wake-up call came when i started reading bedtime stories to my son and i found that at the end of day i would go into his room and i just couldn 't slow down you know i 'd be speed reading the cat in the hat
i 'd be you know i 'd be skipping lines here paragraphs there sometimes a whole page and of course my little boy knew the book inside out so we would quarrel
and what should have been the most relaxing the most intimate the most tender moment of the day when a dad sits down to read to his son became instead this kind of gladiatorial battle of wills a clash between my speed and his slowness
and this went on for some time until i caught myself scanning a newspaper article with timesaving tips for fast people
and one of them made reference to a series of books called the one-minute bedtime story
and i wince saying those words now but my first reaction at the time was very different
my first reflex was to say hallelujah what a great idea
this is exactly what i 'm looking for to speed up bedtime even more
but thankfully a light bulb went on over my head and my next reaction was very different and i took a step back and i thought whoa you know has it really come to this
am i really in such a hurry that i 'm prepared to fob off my son with a sound byte at the end of the day
and i put away the newspaper and i was getting on a plane and i sat there and i did something i hadn 't done for a long time which is i did nothing
i just thought and i thought long and hard
and by the time i got off that plane i 'd decided i wanted to do something about it
i wanted to investigate this whole roadrunner culture and what it was doing to me and to everyone else
and i had two questions in my head
the first was how did we get so fast
and the second is is it possible or even desirable to slow down
now if you think about how our world got so accelerated the usual suspects rear their heads
you think of you know urbanization consumerism the workplace technology
but i think if you cut through those forces you get to what might be the deeper driver the nub of the question which is how we think about time itself
in other cultures time is cyclical
it 's seen as moving in great unhurried circles
it 's always renewing and refreshing itself
whereas in the west time is linear
it 's a finite resource it 's always draining away
you either use it or lose it
time is money as benjamin franklin said
and i think what that does to us psychologically is it creates an equation
time is scarce so what do we do
well well we speed up don 't we
we try and do more and more with less and less time
we turn every moment of every day into a race to the finish line a finish line incidentally that we never reach but a finish line nonetheless
and i guess that the question is is it possible to break free from that mindset
and thankfully the answer is yes because what i discovered when i began looking around that there is a global backlash against this culture that tells us that faster is always better and that busier is best
right across the world people are doing the unthinkable they 're slowing down and finding that although conventional wisdom tells you that if you slow down you 're road kill the opposite turns out to be true that by slowing down at the right moments people find that they do everything better
they eat better they make love better they exercise better they work better they live better
and in this kind of cauldron of moments and places and acts of deceleration lie what a lot of people now refer to as the international slow movement
now if you 'll permit me a small act of hypocrisy i 'll just give you a very quick overview of what 's going on inside the slow movement if you think of food many of you will have heard of the slow food movement
started in italy but has spread across the world and now has 100,000 members in 50 countries
and it 's driven by a very simple and sensible message which is that we get more pleasure and more health from our food when we cultivate cook and consume it at a reasonable pace
i think also the explosion of the organic farming movement and the renaissance of farmers markets are other illustrations of the fact that people are desperate to get away from eating and cooking and cultivating their food on an industrial timetable
they want to get back to slower rhythms
and out of the slow food movement has grown something called the slow cities movement which has started in italy but has spread right across europe and beyond
and in this towns begin to rethink how they organize the urban landscape so that people are encouraged to slow down and smell the roses and connect with one another
so they might curb traffic or put in a park bench or some green space
and in some ways these changes add up to more than the sum of their parts because i think when a slow city becomes officially a slow city it 's kind of like a philosophical declaration
it 's saying to the rest of world and to the people in that town that we believe that in the 21st century slowness has a role to play
in medicine i think a lot of people are deeply disillusioned with the kind of quick-fix mentality you find in conventional medicine
and millions of them around the world are turning to complementary and alternative forms of medicine which tend to tap into sort of slower gentler more holistic forms of healing
now obviously the jury is out on many of these complementary therapies and i personally doubt that the coffee enema will ever you know gain mainstream approval
but other treatments such as acupuncture and massage and even just relaxation clearly have some kind of benefit
and blue-chip medical colleges everywhere are starting to study these things to find out how they work and what we might learn from them
sex there 's an awful lot of fast sex around isn 't there
i was coming to well no pun intended there
i was making my way let 's say slowly to oxford and i went through a news agent and i saw a magazine a men 's magazine and it said on the front how to bring your partner to orgasm in 30 seconds
so you know even sex is on a stopwatch these days
now you know i like a quickie as much as the next person but i think that there 's an awful lot to be gained from slow sex from slowing down in the bedroom
you know you tap into that those deeper sort of psychological emotional spiritual currents and you get a better orgasm with the buildup
you can get more bang for your buck let 's say
i mean the pointer sisters said it most eloquently didn 't they when they sang the praises of a lover with a slow hand
now we all laughed at sting a few years ago when he went tantric but you fast-forward a few years and now you find couples of all ages flocking to workshops or maybe just on their own in their own bedrooms finding ways to put on the brakes and have better sex
and of course in italy where i mean italians always seem to know where to find their pleasure they 've launched an official slow sex movement
the workplace
right across much of the world north america being a notable exception working hours have been coming down
and europe is an example of that and people finding that their quality of life improves as they 're working less and also that their hourly productivity goes up
now clearly there are problems with the 35-hour workweek in france too much too soon too rigid
but other countries in europe notably the nordic countries are showing that it 's possible to have a kick-ass economy without being a workaholic
and norway sweden denmark and finland now rank among the top six most competitive nations on earth and they work the kind of hours that would make the average american weep with envy
and if you go beyond sort of the country level down at the micro-company level more and more companies now are realizing that they need to allow their staff either to work fewer hours or just to unplug to take a lunch break or to go sit in a quiet room to switch off their blackberrys and laptops you at the back mobile phones during the work day or on the weekend so that they have time to recharge and for the brain to slide into that kind of creative mode of thought
it 's not just though these days adults who overwork though is it it 's children too
i 'm 37 and my childhood ended in the mid- 80s and i look at kids now and i 'm just amazed by the way they race around with more homework more tutoring more extracurriculars than we would ever have conceived of a generation ago
and some of the most heartrending emails that i get on my website are actually from adolescents hovering on the edge of burnout pleading with me to write to their parents to help them slow down to help them get off this full-throttle treadmill
but thankfully there is a backlash there in parenting as well and you 're finding that you know towns in the united states are now banding together and banning extracurriculars on a particular day of the month so that people can you know decompress and have some family time and slow down
homework is another thing there are homework bans springing up all over the developed world in schools which had been piling on the homework for years and now they 're discovering that less can be more
so there was a case up in scotland recently where a fee-paying high-achieving private school banned homework for everyone under the age of 13 and the high-achieving parents freaked out and said what are you you know our kids will fall the headmaster said no no your children need to slow down at the end of the day
and just this last month the exam results came in and in math science marks went up 20 percent on average last year
and i think what 's very revealing is that the elite universities who are often cited as the reason that people drive their kids and hothouse them so much are starting to notice the caliber of students coming to them is falling these kids have wonderful marks they have cvs jammed with extracurriculars to the point that would make your eyes water
but they lack spark they lack the ability to think creatively and think outside they don 't know how to dream and so what these ivy league schools and oxford and cambridge and so on are starting to send a message to parents and students that they need to put on the brakes a little bit
and in harvard for instance they send out a letter to undergraduates freshmen telling them that they 'll get more out of life and more out of harvard if they put on the brakes if they do less but give time to things the time that things need to enjoy them to savor them
and even if they sometimes do nothing at all
and that letter is called very revealing i think slow down with an exclamation mark on the end
so wherever you look the message it seems to me is the same that less is very often more that slower is very often better but that said of course it 's not that easy to slow down is it
i mean you heard that i got a speeding ticket while i was researching my book on the benefits of slowness and that 's true but that 's not all of it
i was actually en route to a dinner held by slow food at the time
and if that 's not shaming enough i got that ticket in italy
and if any of you have ever driven on an italian highway you 'll have a pretty good idea of how fast i was going
but why is it so hard to slow down
i think there are various reasons
one is that speed is fun you know speed is sexy
it 's all that adrenaline rush it 's hard to give it up
i think there 's a kind of metaphysical dimension that speed becomes a way of walling ourselves off from the bigger deeper questions
we fill our head with distraction with busyness so that we don 't have to ask am i well am i happy are my children growing up right
are politicians making good decisions on my behalf
another reason although i think perhaps the most powerful reason why we find it hard to slow down is the cultural taboo that we 've erected against slowing down
slow is a dirty word in our culture
it 's a byword for lazy slacker for being somebody who gives up
you know he 's a bit slow it 's actually synonymous with being stupid
i guess what the slow movement the purpose of the slow movement or its main goal really is to tackle that taboo and to say that yes sometimes slow is not the answer that there is such a thing as bad slow
you know i got stuck on the m25 which is a ring road around london recently and spent three-and-a-half hours there and i can tell you that 's really bad slow
but the new idea the sort of revolutionary idea of the slow movement is that there is such a thing as good slow too
and good slow is you know taking the time to eat a meal with your family with the tv switched off
or taking the time to look at a problem from all angles in the office to make the best decision at work
or even simply just taking the time to slow down and savor your life
now one of the things that i found most uplifting about all of this stuff that 's happened around the book since it came out is the reaction to it
and i knew that when my book on slowness came out it would be welcomed by the new age brigade but it 's also been taken up with great gusto by the corporate world you know business press but also big companies and leadership organizations
because people at the top of the chain people like you i think are starting to realize that there 's too much speed in the system there 's too much busyness and it 's time to find or get back to that lost art of shifting gears
another encouraging sign i think is that it 's not just in the developed world that this idea 's been taken up in the developing world in countries that are on the verge of making that leap into first world status china brazil thailand poland and so on these countries have embraced the idea of the slow movement many people in them and there 's a debate going on in their media on the streets
because i think they 're looking at the west and they 're saying well we like that aspect of what you 've got but we 're not so sure about that
so all of that said is it i guess is it possible
that 's really the main question before us today is it possible to slow down and i 'm happy to be able to say to you that the answer is a resounding yes
and i present myself as exhibit a a kind of reformed and rehabilitated speed-aholic
i still love speed you know i live in london and i work as a journalist and i enjoy the buzz and the busyness and the adrenaline rush that comes from both of those things
i play squash and ice hockey two very fast sports and i wouldn 't give them up for the world
but i 've also over the last year or so got in touch with my inner tortoise
and what that means is that i no longer overload myself gratuitously
my default mode is no longer to be a rush-aholic
i no longer hear time 's winged chariot drawing near or at least not as much as i did before
i can actually hear it now because i see my time is ticking off
and the upshot of all of that is that i actually feel a lot happier healthier more productive than i ever have
i feel like i 'm living my life rather than actually just racing through it
and perhaps the most important measure of the success of this is that i feel that my relationships are a lot deeper richer stronger
and for me i guess the litmus test for whether this would work and what it would mean was always going to be bedtime stories because that 's sort of where the journey began and there too the news is rosy you know at the end of the day i go into my son 's room
i don 't wear a watch i switch off my computer so i can 't hear the email pinging into the basket and i just slow down to his pace and we read
and because children have their own tempo and internal clock they don 't do quality time where you schedule 10 minutes for them to open up to you
they need you to move at their rhythm
i find that 10 minutes into a story you know my son will suddenly say you know something happened in the playground today that really bothered me
and we 'll go off and have a conversation on that
and i now find that bedtime stories used to be a box on my to-do list something that i dreaded because it was so slow and i had to get through it quickly
it 's become my reward at the end of the day something i really cherish
and i have a kind of hollywood ending to my talk this afternoon which goes a little bit like this a few months ago i was getting ready to go on another book tour and i had my bags packed
i was downstairs by the front door and i was waiting for a taxi and my son came down the stairs and he 'd made a card for me and he was carrying it
he 'd gone and stapled two cards very like these together and put a sticker of his favorite character tintin on the front
and he said to me or he handed this to me and i read it and it said to daddy love benjamin
and i thought aw that 's really sweet
is that a good luck on the book tour card
and he said no no no daddy this is a card for being the best story reader in the world
and i thought yeah you know this slowing down thing really does work
thank you very much
i am a reformed marketer and i now work in international development
in october i spent some time in the democratic republic of congo which is the [ second ] largest country in africa
in fact it 's as large as western europe but it only has 300 miles of paved roads
the drc is a dangerous place
in the past 10 years five million people have died due to a war in the east
but war isn 't the only reason that life is difficult in the drc
there are many health issues as well
in fact the hiv prevalence rate is 1.3 percent among adults
this might not sound like a large number but in a country with 76 million people it means there are 930,000 that are infected
and due to the poor infrastructure only 25 percent of those are receiving the life-saving drugs that they need
which is why in part donor agencies provide condoms at low or no cost
and so while i was in the drc i spent a lot of time talking to people about condoms including damien
damien runs a hotel outside of kinshasa
it 's a hotel that 's only open until midnight so it 's not a place that you stay
but it is a place where sex workers and their clients come
now damien knows all about condoms but he doesn 't sell them
he said there 's just not in demand
it 's not surprising because only three percent of people in the drc use condoms
joseph and christine who run a pharmacy where they sell a number of these condoms said despite the fact that donor agencies provide them at low or no cost and they have marketing campaigns that go along with them their customers don 't buy the branded versions
they like the generics
and as a marketer i found that curious
and so i started to look at what the marketing looked like
and it turns out that there are three main messages used by the donor agencies for these condoms fear financing and fidelity
they name the condoms things like vive to live or trust
they package it with the red ribbon that reminds us of hiv put it in boxes that remind you who paid for them show pictures of your wife or husband and tell you to protect them or to act prudently
now these are not the kinds of things that someone is thinking about just before they go get a condom
what is it that you think about just before you get a condom
sex
and the private companies that sell condoms in these places they understand this
their marketing is slightly different
the name might not be much different but the imagery sure is
some brands are aspirational and certainly the packaging is incredibly provocative
and this made me think that perhaps the donor agencies had just missed out on a key aspect of marketing understanding who 's the audience
and for donor agencies unfortunately the audience tends to be people that aren 't even in the country they 're working [ in ]
it 's people back home people that support their work people like these
but if what we 're really trying to do is stop the spread of hiv we need to think about the customer the people whose behavior needs to change the couples the young women the young men whose lives depend on it
and so the lesson is this it doesn 't really matter what you 're selling you just have to think about who is your customer and what are the messages that are going to get them to change their behavior
it might just save their lives
thank you
this is the skyline of my hometown new orleans
it was a great place to grow up but it 's one of the most vulnerable spots in the world
half the city is already below sea level
in 2005 the world watched as new orleans and the gulf coast were devastated by hurricane katrina
one thousand eight hundred and thirty-six people died nearly 300,000 homes were lost
these are my mother 's at the top although that 's not her car it was carried there by floodwaters up to the roof and that 's my sister 's below
fortunately they and other family members got out in time but they lost their homes and as you can see just about everything in them
other parts of the world have been hit by storms in even more devastating ways
in 2008 cyclone nargis and its aftermath killed 138,000 in myanmar
climate change is affecting our homes our communities our way of life we should be preparing at every scale and at every opportunity
this talk is about being prepared for and resilient to the changes that are coming and that will affect our homes and our collective home the earth
the changes in these times won 't affect us all equally
there are important distributional consequences and they 're not what you always might think
in new orleans the elderly and female-headed households were among the most vulnerable
for those in vulnerable low-lying nations how do you put a dollar value on losing your country where you ancestors are buried and where will your people go
and how will they cope in a foreign land
will there be tensions over immigration or conflicts over competition for limited resources
it 's already fueled conflicts in chad and darfur
like it or not ready or not this is our future
sure some are looking for opportunities in this new world
that 's the russians planting a flag on the ocean bottom to stake a claim for minerals under the receding arctic sea ice
but while there might be some short-term individual winners our collective losses will far outweigh them
look no further than the insurance industry as they struggle to cope with mounting catastrophic losses from extreme weather events
the military gets it they call climate change a threat multiplier that could harm stability and security while governments around the world are evaluating how to respond
so what can we do how can we prepare and adapt
i 'd like to share three sets of examples starting with adapting to violent storms and floods
in new orleans the i-10 twin spans with sections knocked out in katrina have been rebuilt 21 feet higher to allow for greater storm surge
and these raised and energy-efficient homes were developed by brad pitt and make it right for the hard-hit ninth ward
the devastated church my mom attends has been not only rebuilt higher it 's poised to become the first energy star church in the country
they 're selling electricity back to the grid thanks to solar panels reflective paint and more
their march electricity bill was only 48 dollars
now these are examples of new orleans rebuilding in this way but better if others act proactively with these changes in mind
for example in galveston here 's a resilient home that survived hurricane ike when others on neighboring lots clearly did not
and around the world satellites and warning systems are saving lives in flood-prone areas such as bangladesh
but as important as technology and infrastructure are perhaps the human element is even more critical
we need better planning and systems for evacuation
we need to better understand how people make decisions in times of crisis and why
while it 's true that many who died in katrina did not have access to transportation others who did refused to leave as the storm approached often because available transportation and shelters refused to allow them to take their pets
imagine leaving behind your own pet in an evacuation or a rescue
fortunately in 2006 congress passed the pet evacuation and transportation standards act it spells pets to change that
second preparing for heat and drought
farmers are facing challenges of drought from asia to africa from australia to oklahoma while heat waves linked with climate change have killed tens of thousands of people in western europe in 2003 and again in russia in 2010
in ethiopia 70 percent that 's 7-0 percent of the population depends on rainfall for its livelihood
oxfam and swiss re together with rockefeller foundation are helping farmers like this one build hillside terraces and find other ways to conserve water but they 're also providing for insurance when the droughts do come
the stability this provides is giving the farmers the confidence to invest
it 's giving them access to affordable credit
it 's allowing them to become more productive so that they can afford their own insurance over time without assistance
it 's a virtuous cycle and one that could be replicated throughout the developing world
after a lethal 1995 heat wave turned refrigerator trucks from the popular taste of chicago festival into makeshift morgues chicago became a recognized leader tamping down on the urban heat island impact through opening cooling centers outreach to vulnerable neighborhoods planting trees creating cool white or vegetated green roofs
this is city hall 's green roof next to cook county 's [ portion of the ] roof which is 77 degrees fahrenheit hotter at the surface
washington d.c. last year actually led the nation in new green roofs installed and they 're funding this in part thanks to a five-cent tax on plastic bags
they 're splitting the cost of installing these green roofs with home and building owners
the roofs not only temper urban heat island impact but they save energy and therefore money the emissions that cause climate change and they also reduce stormwater runoff
so some solutions to heat can provide for win-win-wins
third adapting to rising seas
sea level rise threatens coastal ecosystems agriculture even major cities this is what one to two meters of sea level rise looks like in the mekong delta
that 's where half of vietnam 's rice is grown
infrastructure is going to be affected
airports around the world are located on the coast
it makes sense right there 's open space the planes can take off and land without worrying about creating noise or avoiding tall buildings
here 's just one example san francisco airport with 16 inches or more of flooding
imagine the staggering cost of protecting this vital infrastructure with levees
but there might be some changes in store that you might not imagine for example planes require more runway for takeoff because the heated less dense air provides for less lift
san francisco is also spending 40 million dollars to rethink and redesign its water and sewage treatment as water outfall pipes like this one can be flooded with seawater causing backups at the plant harming the bacteria that are needed to treat the waste
so these outfall pipes have been retrofitted to shut seawater off from entering the system
beyond these technical solutions our work at the georgetown climate center with communities encourages them to look at what existing legal and policy tools are available and to consider how they can accommodate change
for example in land use which areas do you want to protect through adding a seawall for example alter by raising buildings or retreat from to allow the migration of important natural systems such as wetlands or beaches
other examples to consider in the u.k. the thames barrier protects london from storm surge
the asian cities climate [ change ] resilience network is restoring vital ecosystems like forest mangroves
these are not only important ecosystems in their own right but they also serve as a buffer to protect inland communities
new york city is incredibly vulnerable to storms as you can see from this clever sign and to sea level rise and to storm surge as you can see from the subway flooding
but back above ground these raised ventilation grates for the subway system show that solutions can be both functional and attractive in fact in new york san francisco and london designers have envisioned ways to better integrate the natural and built environments with climate change in mind
i think these are inspiring examples of what 's possible when we feel empowered to plan for a world that will be different
but now a word of caution
adaptation 's too important to be left to the experts
why well there are no experts
we 're entering uncharted territory and yet our expertise and our systems are based on the past
stationarity is the notion that we can anticipate the future based on the past and plan accordingly and this principle governs much of our engineering our design of critical infrastructure city water systems building codes even water rights and other legal precedents
but we can simply no longer rely on established norms
we 're operating outside the bounds of co2 concentrations that the planet has seen for hundreds of thousands of years
the larger point i 'm trying to make is this
it 's up to us to look at our homes and our communities our vulnerabilities and our exposures to risk and to find ways to not just survive but to thrive and it 's up to us to plan and to prepare and to call on our government leaders and require them to do the same even while they address the underlying causes of climate change
there are no quick fixes
there are no one-size-fits-all solutions
we 're all learning by doing
but the operative word is doing
thank you
i 'm going to present three projects in rapid fire
i don 't have much time to do it
and i want to reinforce three ideas with that rapid-fire presentation
the first is what i like to call a hyper-rational process
it 's a process that takes rationality almost to an absurd level and it transcends all the baggage that normally comes with what people would call sort of a rational conclusion to something
and it concludes in something that you see here that you actually wouldn 't expect as being the result of rationality
the second the second is that this process does not have a signature
there is no authorship architects are obsessed with authorship
this is something that has editing and it has teams
in fact we no longer see within this process the traditional master architect creating a sketch that his minions carry out
and the third is that it challenges and this is in the length of this very hard to support why connect all these things but it challenges the high modernist notion of flexibility
high modernists said we will create sort of singular spaces that are generic
almost anything can happen within them
i call it sort of shotgun flexibility
turn your head this way shoot and you 're bound to kill something
so this is the promise of high modernism within a single space actually any kind of activity can happen
but as we 're seeing operational costs are starting to dwarf capital costs in terms of design parameters
and so with this sort of idea what happens is whatever actually is in the building on opening day or whatever seems to be the most immediate need starts to dwarf the possibility and sort of subsume it of anything else could ever happen
and so we 're proposing a different kind of flexibility something that we call compartmentalized flexibility
and the idea is that you within that continuum identify a series of points and you design specifically to them
they can be pushed off-center a little bit but in the end you actually still get as much of that original spectrum as you originally had hoped
with high modernist flexibility that doesn 't really work
now i 'm going to talk about i 'm going to build up the seattle central library in this way before your eyes in about five or six diagrams and i truly mean this is the design process that you 'll see
with the library staff and the library board we settled on two core positions
this is the first one and this is showing over the last 900 years the evolution of the book and other technologies
this diagram was our sort of position piece about the book and our position was books are technology that 's something people forget but it 's a form of technology that will have to share its dominance with any other form of truly potent technology or media
the second premise and this was something that was very difficult for us to convince the librarians of at first is that libraries since the inception of carnegie library tradition in america had a second responsibility and that was for social roles
ok now this i 'll come back to later but something actually the librarians at first said no this isn 't our mandate
our mandate is media and particularly the book
so what you 're seeing now is actually the design of the building
the upper diagram is what we had seen in a whole host of contemporary libraries that used high modernist flexibility
sort of any activity could happen anywhere
we don 't know the future of the library we don 't know the future of the book and so we 'll use this approach
and what we saw were buildings that were very generic
and worse not only did we see buildings that were very generic so not only does the reading room look like the copy room look like the magazine area but it meant that whatever issue was troubling the library at that moment was starting to engulf every other activity that was happening in it
and in this case what was getting engulfed were these social responsibilities by the expansion of the book
and so we proposed what 's at the lower diagram
very dumb approach simply compartmentalize put those things whose evolution we could predict and i don 't mean that we could say whatever would actually happen in the future but we have some certainty of the spectrum of whatever would happen in the future put those in boxes designed specifically for it and put the things that we can 't predict on the rooftops
so that was the core idea
now we had to convince the library that social roles was equally important to media in order to get them to accept this
what you 're seeing here is actually their program on the left
that 's as it was given to us in all of its clarity and glory
our first operation was to re-digest it back to them show it to them and say you know what we haven 't touched it but only one-third of your own program is dedicated to media and books
two-thirds of it is already dedicated that 's the white band below the thing you said isn 't important is already dedicated to social functions
so once we had presented that back to them they agreed that this sort of core concept could work
we got the right to go back to first principles that 's the third diagram we recombined everything
and then we started making new decisions
what you 're seeing on the right is the design of the library specifically in terms of square footage
on the left of that diagram here you 'll see a series of five platforms sort of combs collective programs
and on the right are the more indeterminate spaces things like reading rooms whose evolution in 20 30 40 years we can 't predict
so that literally was the design of the building
they signed it and to their chagrin we came back a week later and we presented them this
ok and as you can see it is literally the diagram on the right
ok we just sized no really i mean that literally
the things on the on the left-hand side of the diagram those are the boxes
we sized them into five compartments
they 're super-efficient we had a very low budget to work with
we pushed them around on the site to make very literal contextual relationships
the reading room should be able to see the water
the main entrance should have a public plaza in front of it to abide by the zoning code and so forth
so you see the five platforms those are the boxes within each one a very discrete thing is happening
the area in between is sort of an urban continuum these things that we can 't predict their evolution to the same degree
to give you some sense of the power of this idea the biggest block is what we call the book spiral
it 's literally built in a very inexpensive way it is a parking garage for books
it just so happens to be in the sixth through 10th floor of the building but that is not necessarily an expensive approach
and it allows us to organize the entire dewey decimal system on one continuous run no matter how it grows or contracts within the building it will always have its clarity to end the sort of trail of tears that we 've all experienced in public libraries
and so this was the final operation which was to take these blocks as they were all pushed off kilter and to hold onto them with a skin
that skin serves double duty again for economics
one it is the lateral stability for the entire building it is a structural element but its dimensions were designed not only for structure but also for holding on every piece of glass
the glass was then i 'll just use the word impregnated but it had a layer of metal that was called stressed metal
that metal acts as a micro louver so from the exterior of the building the sun sees it as totally opaque but from the interior it 's entirely transparent
so now i 'm going to take you on a tour of the building
let 's see if i can find it for anyone who is gets motion sickness i apologize
so this is the building
and i think what 's important is when we first unveiled the building the public thought saw it as being totally about our whim and ego
and it was defended believe it or not by the librarians they said look we don 't know what it is but we know it 's everything that we need it to be based on the observations that we 've done about the program
this is going into one of the entries
so it 's an unusual building for a public library obviously
so now we 're going into what we call the reading room sorry living room
this is actually a program that we invented with the library
it was recognizing that public libraries are the last vestige of public free space
there are plenty of shopping malls that allow you to get out of the rain in downtown seattle but there are not so many free places that allow you to get out of the rain
so this was an unprogrammed area where people could pretty much do anything including eat yell play chess and so forth
now we 're moving up into what we call the mixing chamber
that was the main sort of technology area in the building
you 'll have to tell me if i 'm going too fast for you
now up
this is actually the place that we put into the building so i could propose to my wife right there
she said yes
i 'm running out of time so i 'm actually going to stop
i can show this to you later
but let 's see if i can very quickly get into the book spiral because i think it 's as i said the most this is the main reading room the most unique part of the building
you dizzy yet
ok so here this is the book spiral
so it 's very indiscernible but it 's actually a continuous stair stepping
it allows you to on one city block go up one full floor so that it 's on a continuum
ok now i 'm going to go back and so i 'm going to hit a second project
i 'm going to go very very quickly through this
now this is the dallas theater it was an unusual client for us because they came to us and they said we need you to do a new building we 've been working in a temporary space for 30 years but because of that temporary space we 've become an infamous theater company
theater is really focused in new york chicago and seattle with the exception of the dallas theater company
and the very fact that they worked on a provisional space meant that for beckett they could blow out a wall they could do cherry orchard and blow a hole through the floor and so forth
so it was a very daunting task for us to do a brand-new building that could keep the be a pristine building but keep this kind of experimental nature
and the second is they were what we call a multi-form theater they do different kinds of performances in repertory
so they in the morning will do something in arena then they 'll do something in proscenium and so forth
and so they needed to be able to quickly transform between different theater organizations and for operational budget reasons this actually no longer happens in pretty much any multi-form theater in the united states so we needed to figure out a way to overcome that
so our thought was to literally put the theater on its head to take those things that were previously defined as front-of-house and back-of-house and stack them above house and below house and to create sort of what we started to call a theater machine
we invest the money in the operation of the building
it 's almost as though the building could be placed anywhere wherever you place it the area underneath it is charged for theatrical performances
and it allowed us to go back to first principles and redefine fly tower acoustic enclosure light enclosure and so forth
and at the push of a button it allows the artistic director to move between proscenium thrust and in fact arena and traverse and flat floor in a very quick transfiguration
so in fact we can go using operational budget we can sorry capital cost we can actually achieve what was no longer achievable in operational cost
and that means that the artistic director now has a palette that he or she can choose from between a series of forms and a series of processions because that enclosure around the theater that is normally trapped with front-of-house and back-of-house spaces has been liberated
so an artistic director has the ability to show have a performance that enters in a wagnerian procession shows the first act in thrust the intermission in a greek procession second act in arena and so forth
so i 'm going to show you what this actually means
this is the theater up close
any portion around the theater actually can be opened discretely
the light enclosure can be lifted separate to the acoustic enclosure so you can do beckett with dallas as the backdrop
portions can be opened so you can now actually have motorcycles drive directly into the performance or you can even just have an open-air performance or for intermissions
the balconies all move to go between those configurations but they also disappear
the proscenium line can also disappear
you can bring enormous objects in so in fact their the dallas theater company their first show will be a play about charles lindbergh and they 'll want to bring in [ a ] real aircraft
and then it also provides them in the off-season the ability to actually rent out their space for entirely different things
this is it at night sorry from a distance
open up entire portions for different kinds of events
and at night
again remove the light enclosure keep the acoustic enclosure
this is a monster truck show
i 'm going to show now the last project
this also is an unusual client
they inverted the whole idea of development
they came to us and they said unlike normal developers they said we want to start out by providing a contemporary art museum in louisville that 's our main goal
and so instead of being a developer that sees an opportunity to make money they saw an ability to be a catalyst in their downtown
and the fact that they wanted to support the contemporary art museum actually built their pro forma so they worked in reverse
and that pro forma led us to a mixed-use building that was very large in order to support their aspirations of the art but it also opened up opportunities for the art itself to collaborate interact with commercial spaces that actually artists more and more want to work within
and it also charged us with thinking about how to have something that was both a single building and a credible sort of sub-building
so now i 'm going to this is louisville 's skyline and i 'm going to take you through various constraints that led to the project
first the physical constraints we actually had to operate on three discrete sites all of them well well smaller than the size of the building
we had to operate next to the new muhammad ali center and respect it
we had to operate within the 100-year floodplain
now this area floods three to four times a year and there 's a levee behind our site similar to the ones that broke in new orleans
have to operate behind the i-64 corridor a street that cuts through the middle of these separate sites
so these we 're starting to build a sort of nightmare of constraints in a bathtub
underneath the bathtub are the city 's main power lines
and there is a pedestrian corridor that they wanted to add that would link a series of cultural buildings and a view corridor because this is the historic district that they didn 't want to obstruct with the new building
and now we 're going to add 1.1 million square feet
and if we did the traditional thing that 1.1 million square feet these are the different programs the traditional thing would be to identify the public elements place them on sites and now we 'd have a really terrible situation a public thing in the middle of a bathtub that floods
and then we would size all the other elements the different commercial elements hotel luxury housing offices and so forth and dump it on top and we would create something that was unviable
in fact and you know this this is called the time warner building
so our strategy was very simple
just lift the entire block flip some of the elements over reposition them so they have appropriate views and relationships to downtown and make circulation connections and reroute the road
so that 's the basic concept and now i 'm going to show you what it leads to
ok it seems a very formal willful gesture but something derived entirely out of the constraints
and again when we unveiled it there was a sort of nervousness that this was about an architect making a statement not an architect who was attempting to solve a series of problems
now within that center zone as i said we have the ability to mix a series of things
so here you can see that these this sort of an x-ray the towers are totally developer-driven they told us the dimensions the sizes and so forth and we focused on taking all the public components the lobbies the bars everything that the different commercial elements would have and combined it in the center in the sort of subway map in the transfer zone that would also include the contemporary art museum
so it creates a situation like this where you have artists who can operate within an art space that also has an amazing view on the 22nd floor but it also has proximity that the curator can either open or close
it allows people on exercise bicycles to be seen or to see the art and so forth
it also means that if an artist wants to invade something like a swimming pool they can begin to do their exhibition in a swimming pool so they 're not forced to always work within the confines of a contemporary gallery space
so how to build this
it 's very simple it 's a chair
so we begin by building the cores
as we 're building the cores we build the contemporary art museum at grade
that allows us to have incredible efficiency and cost efficiency
this is not a high-budget building
the moment the cores get to mid level we finish the art museum we put all the mechanical equipment in it and then we jack it up into the air
this is how they build really large aircraft hangars for instance the ones that they did for the a380
finish the cores finish the meat and you get something that looks like this
now i only have about 30 seconds so i want to start an animation and we 'll conclude with that thank you
chris asked me to add the theater is under construction and this project will start construction in about a year and finish in 2010
18 minutes is an absolutely brutal time limit so i 'm going to dive straight in right at the point where i get this thing to work
here we go i 'm going to talk about five different things
i 'm going to talk about why defeating aging is desirable
i 'm going to talk about why we have to get our shit together and actually talk about this a bit more than we do
i 'm going to talk about feasibility as well of course
i 'm going to talk about why we are so fatalistic about doing anything about aging
and then i 'm going spend perhaps the second half of the talk talking about you know how we might actually be able to prove that fatalism is wrong namely by actually doing something about it
i 'm going to do that in two steps
the first one i 'm going to talk about is how to get from a relatively modest amount of life extension which i 'm going to define as 30 years applied to people who are already in middle-age when you start to a point which can genuinely be called defeating aging
namely essentially an elimination of the relationship between how old you are and how likely you are to die in the next year or indeed to get sick in the first place
and of course the last thing i 'm going to talk about is how to reach that intermediate step that point of maybe 30 years life extension
so i 'm going to start with why we should
now i want to ask a question
hands up anyone in the audience who is in favor of malaria
that was easy ok
ok hands up anyone in the audience who 's not sure whether malaria is a good thing or a bad thing
ok so we all think malaria is a bad thing
that 's very good news because i thought that was what the answer would be
now the thing is i would like to put it to you that the main reason why we think that malaria is a bad thing is because of a characteristic of malaria that it shares with aging
and here is that characteristic
the only real difference is that aging kills considerably more people than malaria does
now i like in an audience in britain especially to talk about the comparison with foxhunting which is something that was banned after a long struggle by the government not very many months ago
i mean i know i 'm with a sympathetic audience here but as we know a lot of people are not entirely persuaded by this logic
and this is actually a rather good comparison it seems to me
you know a lot of people said well you know city boys have no business telling us rural types what to do with our time
it 's a traditional part of the way of life and we should be allowed to carry on doing it
it 's ecologically sound it stops the population explosion of foxes
but ultimately the government prevailed in the end because the majority of the british public and certainly the majority of members of parliament came to the conclusion that it was really something that should not be tolerated in a civilized society
and i think that human aging shares all of these characteristics in spades
what part of this do people not understand
it 's not just about life of course it 's about healthy life you know getting frail and miserable and dependent is no fun whether or not dying may be fun
so really this is how i would like to describe it
it 's a global trance
these are the sorts of unbelievable excuses that people give for aging
and i mean ok i 'm not actually saying that these excuses are completely valueless
there are some good points to be made here things that we ought to be thinking about forward planning so that nothing goes too well so that we minimize the turbulence when we actually figure out how to fix aging
but these are completely crazy when you actually remember your sense of proportion
you know these are arguments these are things that would be legitimate to be concerned about
but the question is are they so dangerous these risks of doing something about aging that they outweigh the downside of doing the opposite namely leaving aging as it is
are these so bad that they outweigh condemning 100,000 people a day to an unnecessarily early death
you know if you haven 't got an argument that 's that strong then just don 't waste my time is what i say
now there is one argument that some people do think really is that strong and here it is
people worry about overpopulation they say well if we fix aging no one 's going to die to speak of or at least the death toll is going to be much lower only from crossing st. giles carelessly
and therefore we 're not going to be able to have many kids and kids are really important to most people
and that 's true
and you know a lot of people try to fudge this question and give answers like this
i don 't agree with those answers i think they basically don 't work
i think it 's true that we will face a dilemma in this respect
we will have to decide whether to have a low birth rate or a high death rate
a high death rate will of course arise from simply rejecting these therapies in favor of carrying on having a lot of kids
and i say that that 's fine the future of humanity is entitled to make that choice
what 's not fine is for us to make that choice on behalf of the future
if we vacillate hesitate and do not actually develop these therapies then we are condemning a whole cohort of people who would have been young enough and healthy enough to benefit from those therapies but will not be because we haven 't developed them as quickly as we could we 'll be denying those people an indefinite life span and i consider that that is immoral
that 's my answer to the overpopulation question
right so the next thing is now why should we get a little bit more active on this
and the fundamental answer is that the pro-aging trance is not as dumb as it looks
it 's actually a sensible way of coping with the inevitability of aging
aging is ghastly but it 's inevitable so you know we 've got to find some way to put it out of our minds and it 's rational to do anything that we might want to do to do that
like for example making up these ridiculous reasons why aging is actually a good thing after all
but of course that only works when we have both of these components
and as soon as the inevitability bit becomes a little bit unclear and we might be in range of doing something about aging this becomes part of the problem
this pro-aging trance is what stops us from agitating about these things
and that 's why we have to really talk about this a lot evangelize i will go so far as to say quite a lot in order to get people 's attention and make people realize that they are in a trance in this regard
so that 's all i 'm going to say about that
i 'm now going to talk about feasibility
and the fundamental reason i think why we feel that aging is inevitable is summed up in a definition of aging that i 'm giving here
a very simple definition
aging is a side effect of being alive in the first place which is to say metabolism
this is not a completely tautological statement it 's a reasonable statement
aging is basically a process that happens to inanimate objects like cars and it also happens to us despite the fact that we have a lot of clever self-repair mechanisms because those self-repair mechanisms are not perfect
so basically metabolism which is defined as basically everything that keeps us alive from one day to the next has side effects
those side effects accumulate and eventually cause pathology
that 's a fine definition so we can put it this way we can say that you know we have this chain of events
and there are really two games in town according to most people with regard to postponing aging
they 're what i 'm calling here the gerontology approach and the geriatrics approach
the geriatrician will intervene late in the day when pathology is becoming evident and the geriatrician will try and hold back the sands of time and stop the accumulation of side effects from causing the pathology quite so soon
of course it 's a very short-term-ist strategy it 's a losing battle because the things that are causing the pathology are becoming more abundant as time goes on
the gerontology approach looks much more promising on the surface because you know prevention is better than cure
but unfortunately the thing is that we don 't understand metabolism very well
in fact we have a pitifully poor understanding of how organisms work even cells we 're not really too good on yet
we 've discovered things like for example rna interference only a few years ago and this is a really fundamental component of how cells work
basically gerontology is a fine approach in the end but it is not an approach whose time has come when we 're talking about intervention
so then what do we do about that
i mean that 's a fine logic that sounds pretty convincing pretty ironclad doesn 't it
but it isn 't
before i tell you why it isn 't i 'm going to go a little bit into what i 'm calling step two
just suppose as i said that we do acquire let 's say we do it today for the sake of argument the ability to confer 30 extra years of healthy life on people who are already in middle age let 's say 55
i 'm going to call that robust human rejuvenation ok
what would that actually mean for how long people of various ages today or equivalently of various ages at the time that these therapies arrive would actually live
in order to answer that question you might think it 's simple but it 's not simple
we can 't just say well if they 're young enough to benefit from these therapies then they 'll live 30 years longer
that 's the wrong answer
and the reason it 's the wrong answer is because of progress
there are two sorts of technological progress really for this purpose
there are fundamental major breakthroughs and there are incremental refinements of those breakthroughs
now they differ a great deal in terms of the predictability of time frames
fundamental breakthroughs very hard to predict how long it 's going to take to make a fundamental breakthrough
it was a very long time ago that we decided that flying would be fun and it took us until 1903 to actually work out how to do it
but after that things were pretty steady and pretty uniform
i think this is a reasonable sequence of events that happened in the progression of the technology of powered flight
we can think really that each one is sort of beyond the imagination of the inventor of the previous one if you like
the incremental advances have added up to something which is not incremental anymore
this is the sort of thing you see after a fundamental breakthrough
and you see it in all sorts of technologies
computers you can look at a more or less parallel time line happening of course a bit later
you can look at medical care i mean hygiene vaccines antibiotics you know the same sort of time frame
so i think that actually step two that i called a step a moment ago isn 't a step at all
that in fact the people who are young enough to benefit from these first therapies that give this moderate amount of life extension even though those people are already middle-aged when the therapies arrive will be at some sort of cusp
they will mostly survive long enough to receive improved treatments that will give them a further 30 or maybe 50 years
in other words they will be staying ahead of the game
the therapies will be improving faster than the remaining imperfections in the therapies are catching up with us
this is a very important point for me to get across
because you know most people when they hear that i predict that a lot of people alive today are going to live to 1,000 or more they think that i 'm saying that we 're going to invent therapies in the next few decades that are so thoroughly eliminating aging that those therapies will let us live to 1,000 or more
i 'm not saying that at all
i 'm saying that the rate of improvement of those therapies will be enough
they 'll never be perfect but we 'll be able to fix the things that 200-year-olds die of before we have any 200-year-olds
and the same for 300 and 400 and so on
i decided to give this a little name which is longevity escape velocity
well it seems to get the point across
so these trajectories here are basically how we would expect people to live in terms of remaining life expectancy as measured by their health for given ages that they were at the time that these therapies arrive
if you 're already 100 or even if you 're 80 and an average 80-year-old we probably can 't do a lot for you with these therapies because you 're too close to death 's door for the really initial experimental therapies to be good enough for you
you won 't be able to withstand them
but if you 're only 50 then there 's a chance that you might be able to pull out of the dive and you know eventually get through this and start becoming biologically younger in a meaningful sense in terms of your youthfulness both physical and mental and in terms of your risk of death from age-related causes
and of course if you 're a bit younger than that then you 're never really even going to get near to being fragile enough to die of age-related causes
so this is a genuine conclusion that i come to that the first 150-year-old we don 't know how old that person is today because we don 't know how long it 's going to take to get these first-generation therapies
but irrespective of that age i 'm claiming that the first person to live to 1,000 subject of course to you know global catastrophes is actually probably only about 10 years younger than the first 150-year-old
and that 's quite a thought
alright so finally i 'm going to spend the rest of the talk my last seven-and-a-half minutes on step one namely how do we actually get to this moderate amount of life extension that will allow us to get to escape velocity
and in order to do that i need to talk about mice a little bit
i have a corresponding milestone to robust human rejuvenation
i 'm calling it robust mouse rejuvenation not very imaginatively
and this is what it is
i say we 're going to take a long-lived strain of mouse which basically means mice that live about three years on average
we do exactly nothing to them until they 're already two years old
and then we do a whole bunch of stuff to them and with those therapies we get them to live on average to their fifth birthday
so in other words we add two years we treble their remaining lifespan starting from the point that we started the therapies
the question then is what would that actually mean for the time frame until we get to the milestone i talked about earlier for humans
which we can now as i 've explained equivalently call either robust human rejuvenation or longevity escape velocity
secondly what does it mean for the public 's perception of how long it 's going to take for us to get to those things starting from the time we get the mice
and thirdly the question is what will it do to actually how much people want it
and it seems to me that the first question is entirely a biology question and it 's extremely hard to answer
one has to be very speculative and many of my colleagues would say that we should not do this speculation that we should simply keep our counsel until we know more
i say that 's nonsense
i say we absolutely are irresponsible if we stay silent on this
we need to give our best guess as to the time frame in order to give people a sense of proportion so that they can assess their priorities
so i say that we have a 50 50 chance of reaching this rhr milestone robust human rejuvenation within 15 years from the point that we get to robust mouse rejuvenation
15 years from the robust mouse
the public 's perception will probably be somewhat better than that
the public tends to underestimate how difficult scientific things are
so they 'll probably think it 's five years away
they 'll be wrong but that actually won 't matter too much
and finally of course i think it 's fair to say that a large part of the reason why the public is so ambivalent about aging now is the global trance i spoke about earlier the coping strategy
that will be history at this point because it will no longer be possible to believe that aging is inevitable in humans since it 's been postponed so very effectively in mice
so we 're likely to end up with a very strong change in people 's attitudes and of course that has enormous implications
so in order to tell you now how we 're going to get these mice i 'm going to add a little bit to my description of aging
i 'm going to use this word damage to denote these intermediate things that are caused by metabolism and that eventually cause pathology
because the critical thing about this is that even though the damage only eventually causes pathology the damage itself is caused ongoing-ly throughout life starting before we 're born
but it is not part of metabolism itself
and this turns out to be useful
because we can re-draw our original diagram this way
we can say that fundamentally the difference between gerontology and geriatrics is that gerontology tries to inhibit the rate at which metabolism lays down this damage
and i 'm going to explain exactly what damage is in concrete biological terms in a moment
and geriatricians try to hold back the sands of time by stopping the damage converting into pathology
and the reason it 's a losing battle is because the damage is continuing to accumulate
so there 's a third approach if we look at it this way
we can call it the engineering approach and i claim that the engineering approach is within range
the engineering approach does not intervene in any processes
it does not intervene in this process or this one
and that 's good because it means that it 's not a losing battle and it 's something that we are within range of being able to do because it doesn 't involve improving on evolution
the engineering approach simply says let 's go and periodically repair all of these various types of damage not necessarily repair them completely but repair them quite a lot so that we keep the level of damage down below the threshold that must exist that causes it to be pathogenic
we know that this threshold exists because we don 't get age-related diseases until we 're in middle age even though the damage has been accumulating since before we were born
why do i say that we 're in range well this is basically it
the point about this slide is actually the bottom
if we try to say which bits of metabolism are important for aging we will be here all night because basically all of metabolism is important for aging in one way or another
this list is just for illustration it is incomplete
the list on the right is also incomplete
it 's a list of types of pathology that are age-related and it 's just an incomplete list
but i would like to claim to you that this list in the middle is actually complete this is the list of types of thing that qualify as damage side effects of metabolism that cause pathology in the end or that might cause pathology
and there are only seven of them
they 're categories of things of course but there 's only seven of them
cell loss mutations in chromosomes mutations in the mitochondria and so on
first of all i 'd like to give you an argument for why that list is complete
of course one can make a biological argument
one can say ok what are we made of
we 're made of cells and stuff between cells
what can damage accumulate in
the answer is long-lived molecules because if a short-lived molecule undergoes damage but then the molecule is destroyed like by a protein being destroyed by proteolysis then the damage is gone too
it 's got to be long-lived molecules
so these seven things were all under discussion in gerontology a long time ago and that is pretty good news because it means that you know we 've come a long way in biology in these 20 years so the fact that we haven 't extended this list is a pretty good indication that there 's no extension to be done
however it 's better than that we actually know how to fix them all in mice in principle and what i mean by in principle is we probably can actually implement these fixes within a decade
some of them are partially implemented already the ones at the top
i haven 't got time to go through them at all but my conclusion is that if we can actually get suitable funding for this then we can probably develop robust mouse rejuvenation in only 10 years but we do need to get serious about it
we do need to really start trying
so of course there are some biologists in the audience and i want to give some answers to some of the questions that you may have
you may have been dissatisfied with this talk but fundamentally you have to go and read this stuff
i 've published a great deal on this i cite the experimental work on which my optimism is based and there 's quite a lot of detail there
the detail is what makes me confident of my rather aggressive time frames that i 'm predicting here
so if you think that i 'm wrong you 'd better damn well go and find out why you think i 'm wrong
and of course the main thing is that you shouldn 't trust people who call themselves gerontologists because as with any radical departure from previous thinking within a particular field you know you expect people in the mainstream to be a bit resistant and not really to take it seriously
so you know you 've got to actually do your homework in order to understand whether this is true
and we 'll just end with a few things
one thing is you know you 'll be hearing from a guy in the next session who said some time ago that he could sequence the human genome in half no time and everyone said well it 's obviously impossible
and you know what happened
so you know this does happen
we have various strategies there 's the methuselah mouse prize which is basically an incentive to innovate and to do what you think is going to work and you get money for it if you win
there 's a proposal to actually put together an institute
this is what 's going to take a bit of money
but i mean look how long does it take to spend that on the war in iraq
not very long ok
it 's got to be philanthropic because profits distract biotech but it 's basically got a 90 percent chance i think of succeeding in this
and i think we know how to do it and i 'll stop there
thank you
ok i don 't know if there 's going to be any questions but i thought i would give people the chance
audience since you 've been talking about aging and trying to defeat it why is it that you make yourself appear like an old man
ag because i am an old man i am actually 158
audience species on this planet have evolved with immune systems to fight off all the diseases so that individuals live long enough to procreate
however as far as i know all the species have evolved to actually die so when cells divide the telomerase get shorter and eventually species die
so why does evolution has seems to have selected against immortality when it is so advantageous or is evolution just incomplete
ag brilliant thank you for asking a question that i can answer with an uncontroversial answer
i 'm going to tell you the genuine mainstream answer to your question which i happen to agree with which is that no aging is not a product of selection evolution [ aging ] is simply a product of evolutionary neglect
in other words we have aging because it 's hard work not to have aging you need more genetic pathways more sophistication in your genes in order to age more slowly and that carries on being true the longer you push it out
so to the extent that evolution doesn 't matter doesn 't care whether genes are passed on by individuals living a long time or by procreation there 's a certain amount of modulation of that which is why different species have different lifespans but that 's why there are no immortal species
the genes don 't care but we do
ag that 's right
audience hello i read somewhere that in the last 20 years the average lifespan of basically anyone on the planet has grown by 10 years
if i project that that would make me think that i would live until 120 if i don 't crash on my motorbike
that means that i 'm one of your subjects to become a 1,000-year-old
ag if you lose a bit of weight
your numbers are a bit out
the standard numbers are that lifespans have been growing at between one and two years per decade
so it 's not quite as good as you might think you might hope
but i intend to move it up to one year per year as soon as possible
audience i was told that many of the brain cells we have as adults are actually in the human embryo and that the brain cells last 80 years or so
if that is indeed true biologically are there implications in the world of rejuvenation
if there are cells in my body that live all 80 years as opposed to a typical you know couple of months
ag there are technical implications certainly
basically what we need to do is replace cells in those few areas of the brain that lose cells at a respectable rate especially neurons but we don 't want to replace them any faster than that or not much faster anyway because replacing them too fast would degrade cognitive function
what i said about there being no non-aging species earlier on was a little bit of an oversimplification
there are species that have no aging hydra for example but they do it by not having a nervous system and not having any tissues in fact that rely for their function on very long-lived cells
last year when i was here i was speaking to you about a swim which i did across the north pole
and while that swim took place three years ago i can remember it as if it was yesterday
i remember standing on the edge of the ice about to dive into the water and thinking to myself i have never ever seen any place on this earth which is just so frightening
the water is completely black
the water is minus 1.7 degrees centigrade or 29 degrees fahrenheit
it 's flipping freezing in that water
and then a thought came across my mind if things go pear-shaped on this swim how long will it take for my frozen body to sink the four and a half kilometers to the bottom of the ocean
and then i said to myself i 've just got to get this thought out of my mind as quickly as possible
and the only way i can dive into that freezing cold water and swim a kilometer is by listening to my ipod and really revving myself up listening to everything from beautiful opera all the way across to puff daddy and then committing myself a hundred percent there is nothing more powerful than the made-up mind and then walking up to the edge of the ice and just diving into the water
and that swim took me 18 minutes and 50 seconds and it felt like 18 days
and i remember getting out of the water and my hands feeling so painful and looking down at my fingers and my fingers were literally the size of sausages because you know we 're made partially of water when water freezes it expands and so the cells in my fingers had frozen and expanded and burst
and the most immediate thought when i came out of that water was the following i 'm never ever going to do another cold water swim in my life again
anyway last year i heard about the himalayas and the melting of the and the melting of the glaciers because of climate change
i heard about this lake lake imja
this lake has been formed in the last couple of years because of the melting of the glacier
the glacier 's gone all the way up the mountain and left in its place this big lake
and i firmly believe that what we 're seeing in the himalayas is the next great big battleground on this earth
nearly two billion people so one in three people on this earth rely on the water from the himalayas
and with a population increasing as quickly as it is and with the water supply from these glaciers because of climate change decreasing so much i think we have a real risk of instability
north you 've got china south you 've india pakistan bangladesh all these countries
and so i decided to walk up to mt everest the highest mountain on this earth and go and do a symbolic swim underneath the summit of mt everest
now i don 't know if any of you have had the opportunity to go to mt everest but it 's quite an ordeal getting up there
28 great big powerful yaks carrying all the equipment up onto this mountain i don 't just have my speedo but there 's a big film crew who then send all the images around the world
the other thing which was so challenging about this swim is not just the altitude
i wanted to do the swim at 5,300 meters above sea level
so it 's right up in the heavens
it 's very very difficult to breath you get altitude sickness
i feels like you 've got a man standing behind you with a hammer just hitting your head all the time
that 's not the worst part of it
the worst part was this year was the year where they decided to do a big cleanup operation on mt everest
many many people have died on mt everest and this was the year they decided to go and recover all the bodies of the mountaineers and then bring them down the mountain
and when you 're walking up the mountain to attempt to do something which no human has ever done before and in fact no fish there are no fish up there swimming at 5,300 meters when you 're trying to do that and then the bodies are coming past you it humbles you and you also realize very very clearly that nature is so much more powerful than we are
and we walked up this pathway all the way up
and to the right hand side of us was this great khumbu glacier
and all the way along the glacier we saw these big pools of melting ice
and then we got up to this small lake underneath the summit of mt everest and i prepared myself the same way as i 've always prepared myself for this swim which was going to be so very difficult
i put on my ipod i listened to some music i got myself as aggressive as possible but controlled aggression and then i hurled myself into that water
i swam as quickly as i could for the first hundred meters and then i realized very very quickly i had a huge problem on my hands
i could barely breathe
i was gasping for air
i then began to choke and then it quickly led to me vomiting in the water
and it all happened so quickly i then i don 't know how it happened but i went underwater
and luckily the water was quite shallow and i was able to push myself off the bottom of the lake and get up and then take another gasp of air
and then i said carry on carry on carry on
i carried on for another five or six strokes and then i had nothing in my body and i went down to the bottom of the lake
and i don 't where i got it from but i was able to somehow pull myself up and as quickly as possible get to the side of the lake
i 've heard it said that drowning is the most peaceful death that you can have
i have never ever heard such utter bollocks
it is the most frightening and panicky feeling that you can have
i got myself to the side of the lake
my crew grabbed me and then we walked as quickly as we could down over the rubble down to our camp
and there we sat down and we did a debrief about what had gone wrong there on mt everest
and my team just gave it to me straight
they said lewis you need to have a radical tactical shift if you want to do this swim
every single thing which you have learned in the past 23 years of swimming you must forget
every single thing which you learned when you were serving in the british army about speed and aggression you put that to one side
we want you to walk up the hill in another two days time
take some time to rest and think about things
we want you to walk up the mountain in two days time and instead of swimming fast swim as slowly as possible
instead of swimming crawl swim breaststroke
and remember never ever swim with aggression
this is the time to swim with real humility
and so we walked back up to the mountain two days later
and i stood there on the edge of the lake and i looked up at mt everest and she is one of the most beautiful mountains on the earth and i said to myself just do this slowly
and i swam across the lake
and i can 't begin to tell you how good i felt when i came to the other side
but i learned two very very important lessons there on mt everest and i thank my team of sherpas who taught me this
the first one is that just because something has worked in the past so well doesn 't mean it 's going to work in the future
and similarly now before i do anything i ask myself what type of mindset do i require to successfully complete a task
and taking that into the world of climate change which is frankly the mt everest of all problems just because we 've lived the way we have lived for so long just because we have consumed the way we have for so long and populated the earth the way we have for so long doesn 't mean that we can carry on the way we are carrying on
the warning signs are all there
when i was born the world 's population was 3.5 billion people
we 're now 6.8 billion people and we 're expected to be 9 billion people by 2050
and then the second lesson the radical tactical shift
and i 've come here to ask you today what radical tactical shift can you take in your relationship to the environment which will ensure that our children and our grandchildren live in a safe world and a secure world and most importantly in a sustainable world
and i ask you please to go away from here and think about that one radical tactical shift which you could make which will make that big difference and then commit a hundred percent to doing it
blog about it tweet about it talk about it and commit a hundred percent because very very few things are impossible to achieve if we really put our whole minds to it
so thank you very very much
today i 'm going to unpack for you three examples of iconic design and it makes perfect sense that i should be the one to do it because i have a bachelor 's degree in literature
but i 'm also a famous minor television personality and an avid collector of design within reach catalogs so i pretty much know everything there is
now i 'm sure you recognize this object many of you probably saw it as you were landing your private zeppelins at los angeles international airport over the past couple of days
this is known as the theme building that is its name for reasons that are still very murky
and it is perhaps the best example we have in los angeles of ancient extraterrestrial architecture
it was first excavated in 1961 as they were building lax although scientists believe that it dates back to the year 2000 before common era when it was used as a busy transdimensional space port by the ancient astronauts who first colonized this planet and raised our species from savagery by giving us the gift of written language and technology and the gift of revolving restaurants
it is thought to have been a replacement for the older space ports located of course at stonehenge and considered to be quite an improvement due to the uncluttered design the lack of druids hanging around all the time and obviously the much better access to parking
when it was uncovered it ushered in a new era of streamlined archaically futuristic design called googie which came to be synonymous with the jet age a misnomer
after all the ancient astronauts who used it did not travel by jet very often preferring instead to travel by feathered serpent powered by crystal skulls
ah yes a table
we use these every day
and on top of it the juicy salif
this is a design by philippe starck who i believe is in the audience at this very moment
and you can tell it is a starck design by its precision its playfulness its innovation and its promise of imminent violence
it is a design that challenges your intuition it is not what you think it is when you first see it
it is not a fork designed to grab three hors d 'oeuvres at a time which would be useful out in the lobby i would say
and despite its obvious influence by the ancient astronauts and its space agey-ness and tripodism it is not something designed to attach to your brain and suck out your thoughts
it is in fact a citrus juicer and when i say that you never see it as anything else again
it is also not a monument to design it is a monument to design 's utility
you can take it home with you unlike the theme building which will stay where it is forever
this is affordable and can come home with you and as such it can sit on your kitchen counter it can 't go in your drawers trust me i found that out the hard way and make your kitchen counter into a monument to design
one other thing about it if you do have one at home let me tell you one of the features you may not know when you fall asleep it comes alive and it walks around your house and goes through your mail and watches you as you sleep
okay what is this object
i have no idea i don 't know what that thing is
it looks terrible is it a little hot plate
i don 't get it
does anyone know chi
it 's an ... iphone. iphone
oh yes that 's right i remember those i had my whole bathroom tiles redone with those back in the good old days
no i have an iphone of course i do
here is my well-loved iphone
i do so many things on this little device
i like to read books on it
more than that i like to buy books on it that i never have to feel guilty about not reading because they go in here and i never look at them again and it 's perfect
i use it every day to measure the weight of an ox for example
every now and then i admit that i complete a phone call on it occasionally
and yet i forget about it all the time
this is a design that once you saw it you forgot about it
it is easy to forget the gasp-inducement that occurred in 2007 when you first touched this thing because it became so quickly pervasive and because of how instantly we adopted these gestures and made it an extension of our life
unlike the theme building this is not alien technology
or i should say what it did was it took technology which unlike people in this room to many other people in the world still feels very alien and made it immediately and instantly feel familiar and intimate
and unlike the juicy salif it does not threaten to attach itself to your brain rather it simply attaches itself to your brain
and you didn 't even notice it happened
so there you go my name is john hodgman
i just explained design
thank you very much
so i thought i will talk about death
seemed to be the passion today
actually it 's not about death
it 's inevitable terrible but really what i want to talk about is i 'm just fascinated by the legacy people leave when they die
that 's what i want to talk about
so art buchwald left his legacy of humor with a video that appeared soon after he died saying hi i 'm art buchwald and i just died
and mike who i met at galapagos a trip which i won at ted is leaving notes on cyberspace where he is chronicling his journey through cancer
and my father left me a legacy of his handwriting through letters and a notebook
in the last two years of his life when he was sick he filled a notebook with his thoughts about me
he wrote about my strengths weaknesses and gentle suggestions for improvement quoting specific incidents and held a mirror to my life
after he died i realized that no one writes to me anymore
handwriting is a disappearing art
i 'm all for email and thinking while typing but why give up old habits for new
why can 't we have letter writing and email exchange in our lives
there are times when i want to trade all those years that i was too busy to sit with my dad and chat with him and trade all those years for one hug
but too late
but that 's when i take out his letters and i read them and the paper that touched his hand is in mine and i feel connected to him
so maybe we all need to leave our children with a value legacy and not a financial one
a value for things with a personal touch an autograph book a soul-searching letter
if a fraction of this powerful ted audience could be inspired to buy a beautiful paper john it 'll be a recycled one and write a beautiful letter to someone they love we actually may start a revolution where our children may go to penmanship classes
so what do i plan to leave for my son
i collect autograph books and those of you authors in the audience know i hound you for them and cds too tracy
i plan to publish my own notebook
as i witnessed my father 's body being swallowed by fire i sat by his funeral pyre and wrote
i have no idea how i 'm going to do it but i am committed to compiling his thoughts and mine into a book and leave that published book for my son
i 'd like to end with a few verses of what i wrote at my father 's cremation
and those linguists please pardon the grammar because i 've not looked at it in the last 10 years
i took it out for the first time to come here
picture in a frame ashes in a bottle boundless energy confined in the bottle forcing me to deal with reality forcing me to deal with being grown up
i hear you and i know that you would want me to be strong but right now i am being sucked down surrounded and suffocated by these raging emotional waters craving to cleanse my soul trying to emerge on a firm footing one more time to keep on fighting and flourishing just as you taught me
your encouraging whispers in my whirlpool of despair holding me and heaving me to shores of sanity to live again and to love again
thank you
i 've always written primarily about architecture about buildings and writing about architecture is based on certain assumptions
an architect designs a building and it becomes a place or many architects design many buildings and it becomes a city and regardless of this complicated mix of forces of politics and culture and economics that shapes these places at the end of the day you can go and you can visit them you can walk around them
you can smell them you can get a feel for them
you can experience their sense of place
but what was striking to me over the last several years was that less and less was i going out into the world and more and more i was sitting in front of my computer screen
and especially since about 2007 when i got an iphone i was not only sitting in front of my screen all day but i was also getting up at the end of the day and looking at this little screen that i carried in my pocket
and what was surprising to me was how quickly my relationship to the physical world had changed
in this very short period of time you know whether you call it the last 15 years or so of being online or the last you know four or five years of being online all the time our relationship to our surroundings had changed in that our attention is constantly divided you know we 're both looking inside the screens and we 're looking out in the world around us
and what was even more striking to me and what i really got hung up on was that the world inside the screen seemed to have no physical reality of its own
if you went and looked for images of the internet this was all that you found this famous image by opte of the internet as the kind of milky way this infinite expanse where we don 't seem to be anywhere on it
we can never seem to grasp it in its totality
it 's always reminded me of the apollo image of the earth the blue marble picture and it 's similarly meant to suggest i think that we can 't really understand it as a whole
we 're always sort of small in the face of its expanse
so if there was this world and this screen and if there was the physical world around me i couldn 't ever get them together in the same place
and then this happened
my internet broke one day as it occasionally does and the cable guy came to fix it and he started with the dusty clump of cables behind the couch and he followed it to the front of my building and into the basement and out to the back yard and there was this big jumble of cables against the wall
and then he saw a squirrel running along the wire and he said there 's your problem
a squirrel is chewing on your internet
and this seemed astounding the internet is a transcendent idea it 's a set of protocols that has changed everything from shopping to dating to revolutions
it was unequivocally not something a squirrel could chew on
but that in fact seemed to be the case
a squirrel had in fact chewed on my internet
and then i got this image in my head of what would happen if you yanked the wire from the wall and if you started to follow it where would it go
was the internet actually a place that you could visit
could i go there who would i meet
you know was there something actually out there
and the answer by all accounts was no
this was the internet this black box with a red light on it as represented in the sitcom the it crowd
normally it lives on the top of big ben because that 's where you get the best reception but they had negotiated that their colleague could borrow it for the afternoon to use in an office presentation
the elders of the internet were willing to part with it for a short while and she looks at it and she says this is the internet the whole internet is it heavy
they say of course not the internet doesn 't weigh anything
and i was embarrassed i was looking for this thing that only fools seem to look for
the internet was that amorphous blob or it was a silly black box with a blinking red light on it
it wasn 't a real world out there
but in fact it is there is a real world of the internet out there and that 's what i spent about two years visiting these places of the internet i was in large data centers that use as much power as the cities in which they sit and i visited places like this 60 hudson street in new york which is one of the buildings in the world one of a very short list of buildings about a dozen buildings where more networks of the internet connect to each other than anywhere else
and that connection is an unequivocally physical process
it 's about the router of one network a facebook or a google or a b.t. or a comcast or a time warner whatever it is connecting with usually a yellow fiber optic cable up into the ceiling and down into the router of another network and that 's unequivocally physical and it 's surprisingly intimate
a building like 60 hudson and a dozen or so others has 10 times more networks connecting within it than the next tier of buildings
there 's a very short list of these places
and 60 hudson in particular is interesting because it 's home to about a half a dozen very important networks which are the networks which serve the undersea cables that travel underneath the ocean that connect europe and america and connect all of us
and it 's those cables in particular that i want to focus on
if the internet is a global phenomenon if we live in a global village it 's because there are cables underneath the ocean cables like this
and in this dimension they are incredibly small
you can you hold them in your hand they 're like a garden hose
but in the other dimension they are incredibly expansive as expansive as you can imagine
they stretch across the ocean they 're three or five or eight thousand miles in length and if the material science and the computational technology is incredibly complicated the basic physical process is shockingly simple light goes in on one end of the ocean and comes out on the other and it usually comes from a building called a landing station that 's often tucked away inconspicuously in a little seaside neighborhood and there are amplifiers that sit on the ocean floor that look kind of like bluefin tuna and every 50 miles they amplify the signal and since the rate of transmission is incredibly fast the basic unit is a 10-gigabit-per-second wavelength of light maybe a thousand times your own connection or capable of carrying 10,000 video streams but not only that but you 'll put not just one wavelength of light through one of the fibers but you 'll put maybe 50 or 60 or 70 different wavelengths or colors of light through a single fiber and then you 'll have maybe eight fibers in a cable four going in each direction
and they 're tiny they 're the thickness of a hair
and then they connect to the continent somewhere
they connect in a manhole like this literally this is where the 5,000-mile cable plugs in
this is in halifax a cable that stretches from halifax to ireland
and the landscape is changing three years ago when i started thinking about this there was one cable down the western coast of africa represented in this map by steve song as that thin black line
now there are six cables and more coming three down each coast
because once a country gets plugged in by one cable they realize that it 's not enough if they 're going to build an industry around it they need to know that their connection isn 't tenuous but permanent because if a cable breaks you have to send a ship out into the water throw a grappling hook over the side pick it up find the other end and then fuse the two ends back together and then dump it over
it 's an intensely intensely physical process
so this is my friend simon cooper who until very recently worked for tata communications the communications wing of tata the big indian industrial conglomerate
and i 've never met him we 've only communicated via this telepresence system which always makes me think of him as the man inside the internet
and he is english the undersea cable industry is dominated by englishmen and they all seem to be 42
because they all started at the same time with the boom about 20 years ago
and tata had gotten its start as a communications business when they bought two cables one across the atlantic and one across the pacific and proceeded to add pieces onto them until they had built a belt around the world which means they will send your bits to the east or the west
they have this is literally a beam of light around the world and if a cable breaks in the pacific it 'll send it around the other direction and then having done that they started to look for places to wire next
they looked for the unwired places and that 's meant north and south primarily these cables to africa
but what amazes me is simon 's incredible geographic imagination
he thinks about the world with this incredible expansiveness
and i was particularly interested because i wanted to see one of these cables being built see you know all the time online we experience these fleeting moments of connection these sort of brief adjacencies a tweet or a facebook post or an email and it seemed like there was a physical corollary to that
it seemed like there was a moment when the continent was being plugged in and i wanted to see that
and simon was working on a new cable wacs the west africa cable system that stretched from lisbon down the west coast of africa to cote d 'ivoire to ghana to nigeria to cameroon
and he said there was coming soon depending on the weather but he 'd let me know when and so with about four days notice he said to go to this beach south of lisbon and a little after 9 this guy will walk out of the water
and he 'll be carrying a green nylon line a lightweight line called a messenger line and that was the first link between sea and land this link that would then be leveraged into this 9,000-mile path of light
then a bulldozer began to pull the cable in from this specialized cable landing ship and it was floated on these buoys until it was in the right place
then you can see the english engineers looking on
and then once it was in the right place he got back in the water holding a big knife and he cut each buoy off and the buoy popped up into the air and the cable dropped to the sea floor and he did that all the way out to the ship and when he got there they gave him a glass of juice and a cookie and then he jumped back in and he swam back to shore and then he lit a cigarette
and then once that cable was on shore they began to prepare to connect it to the other side for the cable that had been brought down from the landing station
and first they got it with a hacksaw and then they start sort of shaving away at this plastic interior with a sort of working like chefs and then finally they 're working like jewelers to get these hair-thin fibers to line up with the cable that had come down and with this hole-punch machine they fuse it together
and when you see these guys going at this cable with a hacksaw you stop thinking about the internet as a cloud
it starts to seem like an incredibly physical thing
and what surprised me as well was that as much as this is based on the most sophisticated technology as much as this is an incredibly new thing the physical process itself has been around for a long time and the culture is the same
you see the local laborers you see the english engineer giving directions in the background and more importantly the places are the same these cables still connect these classic port cities places like lisbon mombasa mumbai singapore new york
and then the process on shore takes around three or four days and then when it 's done they put the manhole cover back on top and they push the sand over that and we all forget about it
and it seems to me that we talk a lot about the cloud but every time we put something on the cloud we give up some responsibility for it
we are less connected to it we let other people worry about it
and that doesn 't seem right
there 's a great neal stephenson line where he says that wired people should know something about wires
and we should know i think we should know where our internet comes from and we should know what it is that physically physically connects us all
thank you
thanks
a human child is born and for quite a long time is a consumer
it cannot be consciously a contributor
it is helpless
it doesn 't know how to survive even though it is endowed with an instinct to survive
it needs the help of mother or a foster mother to survive
it can 't afford to doubt the person who tends the child
it has to totally surrender as one surrenders to an anesthesiologist
it has to totally surrender
that implies a lot of trust
that implies the trusted person won 't violate the trust
as the child grows it begins to discover that the person trusted is violating the trust
it doesn 't know even the word violation
therefore it has to blame itself a wordless blame which is more difficult to really resolve the wordless self-blame
as the child grows to become an adult so far it has been a consumer but the growth of a human being lies in his or her capacity to contribute to be a contributor
one cannot contribute unless one feels secure one feels big one feels i have enough
to be compassionate is not a joke
it 's not that simple
one has to discover a certain bigness in oneself
that bigness should be centered on oneself not in terms of money not in terms of power you wield not in terms of any status that you can command in the society but it should be centered on oneself
the self you are self-aware
on that self it should be centered a bigness a wholeness
otherwise compassion is just a word and a dream
you can be compassionate occasionally more moved by empathy than by compassion
thank god we are empathetic
when somebody 's in pain we pick up the pain
in a wimbledon final match these two guys fight it out
each one has got two games
it can be anybody 's game
what they have sweated so far has no meaning
one person wins
the tennis etiquette is both the players have to come to the net and shake hands
the winner boxes the air and kisses the ground throws his shirt as though somebody is waiting for it
and this guy has to come to the net
when he comes to the net you see his whole face changes
it looks as though he 's wishing that he didn 't win
why empathy
that 's human heart
no human heart is denied of that empathy
no religion can demolish that by indoctrination
no culture no nation and nationalism nothing can touch it because it is empathy
and that capacity to empathize is the window through which you reach out to people you do something that makes a difference in somebody 's life even words even time
compassion is not defined in one form
there 's no indian compassion
there 's no american compassion
it transcends nation the gender the age
why because it is there in everybody
it 's experienced by people occasionally
then this occasional compassion we are not talking about it will never remain occasional
by mandate you cannot make a person compassionate
you can 't say please love me
love is something you discover
it 's not an action but in the english language it is also an action
i will come to it later
so one has got to discover a certain wholeness
i am going to cite the possibility of being whole which is within our experience everybody 's experience
in spite of a very tragic life one is happy in moments which are very few and far between
and the one who is happy even for a slapstick joke accepts himself and also the scheme of things in which one finds oneself
that means the whole universe known things and unknown things
all of them are totally accepted because you discover your wholeness in yourself
the subject me and the object the scheme of things fuse into oneness an experience nobody can say i am denied of an experience common to all and sundry
that experience confirms that in spite of all your limitations all your wants desires unfulfilled and the credit cards and layoffs and finally baldness you can be happy
but the extension of the logic is that you don 't need to fulfill your desire to be happy
you are the very happiness the wholeness that you want to be
there 's no choice in this that only confirms the reality that the wholeness cannot be different from you cannot be minus you
it has got to be you
you cannot be a part of wholeness and still be whole
your moment of happiness reveals that reality that realization that recognition maybe i am the whole
maybe the swami is right
maybe the swami is right you start your new life
then everything becomes meaningful
i have no more reason to blame myself
if one has to blame oneself one has a million reasons plus many
but if i say in spite of my body being limited if it is black it is not white if it is white it is not black body is limited any which way you look at it limited
your knowledge is limited health is limited and power is therefore limited and the cheerfulness is going to be limited
compassion is going to be limited
everything is going to be limitless
you cannot command compassion unless you become limitless and nobody can become limitless either you are or you are not period
and there is no way of your being not limitless too
your own experience reveals in spite of all limitations you are the whole
and the wholeness is the reality of you when you relate to the world
it is love first
when you relate to the world the dynamic manifestation of the wholeness is what we say love
and itself becomes compassion if the object that you relate to evokes that emotion
then that again transforms into giving into sharing
you express yourself because you have compassion
to discover compassion you need to be compassionate
to discover the capacity to give and share you need to be giving and sharing
there is no shortcut it is like swimming by swimming
you learn swimming by swimming
you cannot learn swimming on a foam mattress and enter into water
you learn swimming by swimming you learn cycling by cycling
you learn cooking by cooking having some sympathetic people around you to eat what you cook
and therefore what i say you have to fake it and make it
you need to
my predecessor meant that
you have to act it out
you have to act compassionately
there is no verb for compassion but you have an adverb for compassion
that 's interesting to me
you act compassionately
but then how to act compassionately if you don 't have compassion
that is where you fake
you fake it and make it this is the mantra of the united states of america
you fake it and make it
you act compassionately as though you have compassion grind your teeth take all the support system
if you know how to pray pray
ask for compassion
let me act compassionately
do it
you 'll discover compassion and also slowly a relative compassion and slowly perhaps if you get the right teaching you 'll discover compassion is a dynamic manifestation of the reality of yourself which is oneness wholeness and that 's what you are
with these words thank you very much
the kraken a beast so terrifying it was said to devour men and ships and whales and so enormous it could be mistaken for an island
in assessing the merits of such tales it 's probably wise to keep in mind that old sailor 's saw that the only difference between a fairytale and a sea story is a fairytale begins once upon a time and a sea story begins this ain 't no shit
every fish that gets away grows with every telling of the tale
nevertheless there are giants in the ocean and we now have video proof as those of you that saw the discovery channel documentary are no doubt aware
i was one of the three scientists on this expedition that took place last summer off japan
i 'm the short one
the other two are dr. tsunemi kubodera and dr. steve o 'shea
i owe my participation in this now-historic event to ted
in 2010 there was a ted event called mission blue held aboard the lindblad explorer in the galapagos as part of the fulfillment of sylvia earle 's ted wish
i spoke about a new way of exploring the ocean one that focuses on attracting animals instead of scaring them away
mike degruy was also invited and he spoke with great passion about his love of the ocean and he also talked to me about applying my approach to something he 's been involved with for a very long time which is the hunt for the giant squid
it was mike that got me invited to the squid summit a gathering of squid experts at the discovery channel that summer during shark week
i gave a talk on unobtrusive viewing and optical luring of deep sea squid in which i emphasized the importance of using quiet unobtrusive platforms for exploration
this came out of hundreds of dives i have made farting around in the dark using these platforms and my impression that i saw more animals working from the submersible than i did with either of the remote-operated vehicles
but that could just be because the submersible has a wider field of view
but i also felt like i saw more animals working with the tiburon than the ventana two vehicles with the same field of view but different propulsion systems
so my suspicion was that it might have something to do with the amount of noise they make
so i set up a hydrophone on the bottom of the ocean and i had each of these fly by at the same speed and distance and recorded the sound they made
the johnson sea-link which you can probably just barely hear here uses electric thrusters very very quiet
the tiburon also uses electric powered thrusters
it 's also pretty quiet but a bit noisier
but most deep-diving rovs these days use hydraulics and they sound like the ventana
i think that 's got to be scaring a lot of animals away
so for the deep sea squid hunt i proposed using an optical lure attached to a camera platform with no thrusters no motors just a battery-powered camera and the only illumination coming from red light that 's invisible to most deep-sea animals that are adapted to see primarily blue
that 's visible to our eye but it 's the equivalent of infrared in the deep sea
so this camera platform which we called the medusa could just be thrown off the back of the ship attached to a float at the surface with over 2,000 feet of line it would just float around passively carried by the currents and the only light visible to the animals in the deep would be the blue light of the optical lure which we called the electronic jellyfish or e-jelly because it was designed to imitate the bioluminescent display of the common deep sea jellyfish atolla
now this pinwheel of light that the atolla produces is known as a bioluminescent burglar alarm and is a form of defense
the reason that the electronic jellyfish worked as a lure is not because giant squid eat jellyfish but it 's because this jellyfish only resorts to producing this light when it 's being chewed on by a predator and its only hope for escape may be to attract the attention of a larger predator that will attack its attacker and thereby afford it an opportunity for escape
it 's a scream for help a last-ditch attempt for escape and a common form of defense in the deep sea
the approach worked
whereas all previous expeditions had failed to garner a single video glimpse of the giant we managed six and the first triggered wild excitement
edith widder oh my god oh my god are you kidding me other scientists oh ho ho that 's just hanging there
ew it was like it was teasing us doing a kind of fan dance now you see me now you don 't and we had four such teasing appearances and then on the fifth it came in and totally wowed us
scientists ooh bang oh my god whoa
ew the full monty
what really wowed me about that was the way it came in up over the e-jelly and then attacked the enormous thing next to it which i think it mistook for the predator on the e-jelly
but even more incredible was the footage shot from the triton submersible
what was not mentioned in the discovery documentary was that the bait squid that dr. kubodera used a one-meter long diamondback squid had a light attached to it a squid jig of the type that longline fishermen use and i think it was this light that brought the giant in
now what you 're seeing is the intensified camera 's view under red light and that 's all dr. kubodera could see when the giant comes in here
and then he got so excited he turned on his flashlight because he wanted to see better and the giant didn 't run away so he risked turning on the white lights on the submersible bringing a creature of legend from the misty history into high-resolution video
it was absolutely breathtaking and had this animal had its feeding tentacles intact and fully extended it would have been as tall as a two-story house
how could something that big live in our ocean and yet remain unfilmed until now
we 've only explored about five percent of our ocean
there are great discoveries yet to be made down there fantastic creatures representing millions of years of evolution and possibly bioactive compounds that could benefit us in ways that we can 't even yet imagine
yet we have spent only a tiny fraction of the money on ocean exploration that we 've spent on space exploration
we need a nasa-like organization for ocean exploration because we need to be exploring and protecting our life support systems here on earth
we need thank you
exploration is the engine that drives innovation
innovation drives economic growth
so let 's all go exploring but let 's do it in a way that doesn 't scare the animals away or as mike degruy once said if you want to get away from it all and see something you 've never seen or have an excellent chance of seeing something that no one 's ever seen get in a sub
he should have been with us for this adventure
we miss him
okay it 's great to be back at ted
why don 't i just start by firing away with the video
okay glass record a video
this is it we 're on in two minutes
okay glass hang out with the flying club
google photos of tiger heads hmm
you ready you ready
right there okay glass take a picture
go
man 6 holy [ beep ] that is awesome
whoa look at that snake
woman 3 okay glass record a video
man 7 after this bridge first exit
man 8 okay a12 right there
man 9 google say delicious in thai
google glass อร่อยman 9 mmm อร่อย
woman 4 google jellyfish
man 10 it 's beautiful
sergey brin oh sorry i just got this message from a nigerian prince
he needs help getting 10 million dollars
i like to pay attention to these because that 's how we originally funded the company and it 's gone pretty well
though in all seriousness this position that you just saw me in looking down at my phone that 's one of the reasons behind this project project glass
because we ultimately questioned whether this is the ultimate future of how you want to connect to other people in your life how you want to connect to information
should it be by just walking around looking down
but that was the vision behind glass and that 's why we 've created this form factor
okay and i don 't want to go through all the things it does and whatnot but i want to tell you a little bit more about the motivation behind what led to it
in addition to potentially socially isolating yourself when you 're out and about looking at your phone it 's kind of is this what you 're meant to do with your body
you 're standing around there and you 're just rubbing this featureless piece of glass
you 're just kind of moving around
so when we developed glass we thought really about can we make something that frees your hands
you saw all of the things people are doing in the video back there
they were all wearing glass and that 's how we got that footage
and also you want something that frees your eyes
that 's why we put the display up high out of your line of sight so it wouldn 't be where you 're looking and it wouldn 't be where you 're making eye contact with people
and also we wanted to free up the ears so the sound actually goes through conducts straight to the bones in your cranium which is a little bit freaky at first but you get used to it
and ironically if you want to hear it better you actually just cover your ear which is kind of surprising but that 's how it works
my vision when we started google 15 years ago was that eventually you wouldn 't have to have a search query at all
you 'd just have information come to you as you needed it
and this is now 15 years later sort of the first form factor that i think can deliver that vision when you 're out and about on the street talking to people and so forth
this project has lasted now been just over two years
we 've learned an amazing amount
it 's been really important to make it comfortable
so our first prototypes we built were huge
it was like cell phones strapped to your head
it was very heavy pretty uncomfortable
we had to keep it secret from our industrial designer until she actually accepted the job and then she almost ran away screaming
but we 've come a long way
and the other really unexpected surprise was the camera
our original prototypes didn 't have cameras at all but it 's been really magical to be able to capture moments spent with my family my kids
i just never would have dug out a camera or a phone or something else to take that moment
and lastly i 've realized in experimenting with this device that i also kind of have a nervous tic
the cell phone is yeah you have to look down on it and all that but it 's also kind of a nervous habit
like if i smoked i 'd probably just smoke instead
i would just light up a cigarette it would look cooler
you know i 'd be like but in this case you know i whip this out and i sit there and look as if i have something very important to do or attend to
but it really opened my eyes to how much of my life i spent just secluding away be it email or social posts or whatnot even though it wasn 't really there 's nothing really that important or that pressing
and with this i know i will get certain messages if i really need them but i don 't have to be checking them all the time
yeah i 've really enjoyed actually exploring the world more doing more of the crazy things like you saw in the video
thank you all very much
hello voicemail my old friend
i 've called for tech support again
i ignored my boss warning i called on a monday morning
now it 's evening and my dinner first grew cold and then grew mold
i 'm still on hold i 'm listening to the sounds of silence
i don 't think you understand i think your phone lines are unmanned
i punched every touch tone i was told but i still spent 18 hours on hold
it 's not enough your software crashed my mac and it constantly hangs and bombs it erased my roms now the mac makes the sounds of silence
in my dreams i fantasize of wreaking vengeance on you guys
say your motorcycle crashes
blood comes gushing from your gashes with your fading strength you call 9-1-1 and you pray for a trained md but you get me
and you listen to the sounds of silence
thank you good evening and welcome to spot the ted presenter who used to be a broadway accompanist
ok when i was offered the times column six years ago the deal was like this you 'll be sent the coolest hottest slickest new gadgets
every week it 'll arrive at your door
you get to try them out play with them evaluate them until the novelty wears out before you have to send them back
and you 'll get paid for it you can think about it if you want
i 've always been a technology nut and i absolutely love it
the job though came with one small downside and that is they intended to publish my email address at the end of every column
and what i 've noticed is first of all you get an incredible amount of email
if you ever are feeling lonely get a new york times column because you will get hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of emails and the email i 'm getting a lot today is about frustration
people are feeling like things ok i just had an alarm come up on my screen lucky you can 't see it
people are feeling overwhelmed they 're feeling like it 's too much technology too fast
it may be good technology but i feel like there 's not enough of a support structure
there 's not enough help there 's not enough thought put into the design of it to make it easy and enjoyable to use
one time i wrote a column about my efforts to reach dell technical support and within 12 hours there were 700 messages from readers on the feedback boards on the times website from users saying me too and here 's my tale of woe i call it software rage
and man let me tell you whoever figures out how to make money off of this frustration will oh how did that get up there just kidding
ok so why is the problem accelerating part of the problem is ironically because the industry has put so much thought into making things easier to use
i 'll show you what i mean
this is what the computer interface used to look like dos
over the years it 's gotten easier to use
this is the original mac operating system
reagan was president madonna was still a brunette
and the entire operating system this is the good part the entire operating system fit in 211k
you couldn 't put the mac os 10 logo in 211k
so the irony is that as these things became easier to use a less technical broader audience was coming into contact with this equipment for the first time
i once had the distinct privilege of sitting in on the apple call center for a day
the guy had a duplicate headset for me to listen to
and the calls that you know how they say your call may be recorded for quality assurance
mm-mmm your call may be recorded so that they can collect the funniest dumb user stories and pass them around on a cd
which they do
and i have a copy
it 's in your tedgift bag no no
with your voices on it
some of the stories are just so classic and yet so understandable
a woman called apple to complain that her mouse was squeaking making a squeaking noise
and the technician said well ma 'am what do you mean your mouse is squeaking
she says all i can tell you is that it squeaks louder the faster i move it across the screen
and the technician 's like ma 'am you 've got the mouse up against the screen
she goes well the message said click here to continue well if you like that one how much time have we got
another one a guy called this is absolutely true his computer had crashed and he told the technician he couldn 't restart it no matter how many times he typed 11
and the technician said what why are you typing 11 he said the message says error type 11 so we must admit that some of the blame falls squarely at the feet of the users
but why is the technical overload crisis the complexity crisis accelerating now in the hardware world it 's because we the consumers want everything to be smaller smaller smaller
so the gadgets are getting tinier and tinier but our fingers are essentially staying the same size
so it gets to be more and more of a challenge
software is subject to another primal force the mandate to release more and more versions
when you buy a piece of software it 's not like buying a vase or a candy bar where you own it
it 's more like joining a club where you pay dues every year
and every year they say we 've added more features and we 'll sell it to you for $ 99
i know one guy who 's spent $ 4,000 just on photoshop over the years
and software companies make 35 percent of their revenue from just these software upgrades
i call it the software upgrade paradox which is that if you improve a piece of software enough times you eventually ruin it
i mean microsoft word was last just a word processor in you know the eisenhower administration
but what 's the alternative microsoft actually did this experiment they said well wait a minute everyone complains that we 're adding so many features
let 's create a word processor that 's just a word processor
simple pure does not do web pages is not a database
and it came out it was called microsoft write
and none of you are nodding in acknowledgment because it died
it tanked no one ever bought it
i call this the sport utility principle people like to surround themselves with unnecessary power right
they don 't need the database and the website but they 're like well i 'll upgrade because i might you know i might need that someday
so the problem is as you add more features where are they going to go
where are you going to stick them you only have so many design tools
you can do buttons you can do sliders pop-up menus sub-menus
but if you 're not careful about how you choose you wind up with this
this is an un-retouched this is not a joke un-retouched photo of microsoft word the copy that you have with all the toolbars open
you 've obviously never opened all the toolbars but all you have to type in is this little teeny window down here
and we 've arrived at the age of interface matrices where there are so many features and options you have to do two dimensions you know a vertical and a horizontal you guys all complained about how microsoft word is always bulleting your lists and underlining your links automatically
the off switch is in there somewhere
i 'm telling you it 's there
part of the art of designing a simple good interface is knowing when to use which one of these features
here is the log off dialogue box for windows 2000
there are only four choices so why are they in a pop-up menu
it 's not like the rest of the screen is so full of other components that you need to collapse the choices
they could have put them all out in view
here 's apple 's take on the exact same dialogue box
thank you yes i designed the dialogue box no no no
already we can see that apple and microsoft have a severely divergent approach to software design
microsoft 's approach to simplicity tends to be let 's break it down let 's just make it more steps
there are these wizards everywhere
and you know there 's a new version of windows coming out this fall
if they continue at this pace there 's absolutely no telling where they might wind up
welcome to the type-a-word wizard ok i 'll bite let 's click next to continue
from the drop-down menu choose the first letter you want to type ok
so there is a limit that we don 't want to cross so what is the answer
how do you pack in all these features in a simple intelligent way
i believe in consistency with possible real-world equivalents trashcan folder when possible label things mostly
but i beg of the designers here to break all those rules if they violate the biggest rule of all which is intelligence now what do i mean by that
i 'm going to give you some examples where intelligence makes something not consistent but it 's better
if you are buying something on the web you 're supposed to put in your address and you 're supposed to choose which country you 're from ok
there are 200 countries in the world we like to think of the internet as a global village
i 'm sorry it 's not one yet
it 's mainly like the united states europe and japan
so why is united states in the u s
you have to scroll like seven screens-full to get to it
now it would be inconsistent to put united states first but it would be intelligent this one 's been touched on before but why in god 's name do you shut down a windows pc by clicking a button called start
here 's another pet one of mine you have a printer
most of the time you want to print one copy of your document in page order on that printer
so why in god 's name do you see this every time you print
it 's like a 747 shuttle cockpit
and one of the buttons at the bottom you 'll notice is not print
now i 'm not saying that apple is the only company who has embraced the cult of simplicity
palm is also especially in the old days wonderful about this
i actually got to speak to palm when they were flying high in the 90s and after the talk i met one of the employees
he says nice talk and i said thank you what do you do here
he said i 'm a tap counter
i 'm like you 're a what he goes well jeff hawkins the ceo says if any task on the palm pilot takes more than three taps of the stylus it 's too long and it has to be redesigned so i 'm the tap counter
i 'm going to show you an example of a company that does not have a tap counter
this is microsoft word when you want to create a new blank document in word it could happen
you go up to the file menu and you choose new now what happens when you choose new do you get a new blank document
you do not
on the opposite side of the monitor a task bar appears and somewhere in those links by the way not at the top somewhere in those links is a button that makes you a new document
that is a company not counting taps
you know i don 't want to just stand here and make fun of microsoft ...
audience go on
david pogue yes i do
the bill gates song
i 've been a geek forever and i wrote the very first dos
i put my software and ibm together i got profit and they got the loss
i write the code that makes the whole world run
i 'm gettin royalties from everyone
sometimes it 's garbage but the press is snowed
you buy the box i 'll sell the code
every software company is doing microsoft 's r & amp d .
you can 't keep a good idea down these days
even windows is a hack we 're kind of based loosely on the mac
so it 's big so it 's slow you 've got nowhere to go i 'm not doing this for praise
i write the code that fits the world today
big mediocrity in every way
we 've entered planet domination mode
you 'll have no choice you 'll buy my code
i am bill gates and i write the code
but actually i believe there are really two microsofts
there 's the old one responsible for windows and office
they 're dying to throw the whole thing out and start fresh but they can 't they 're locked in because so many add-ons and other company stuff locks into the old 1982 chassis
but there 's also a new microsoft that 's really doing good simple interface designs
i liked the media center pc i liked the microsoft spot watch
the wireless watch flopped miserably in the market but it wasn 't because it wasn 't simply and beautifully designed
let 's put it this way would you pay $ 10 a month to have a watch that has to be recharged every night like your cell phone and stops working when you leave your area code
the signs might indicate that the complexity crunch is only going to get worse
so is there any hope the screens are getting smaller
people are illuminating putting manuals in the boxes
the things are coming out at a faster pace
it 's funny when steve jobs came back to apple in 1997 after 12 years away it was the macworld expo he came to the stage in that black turtleneck and jeans and he sort of did this the crowd went wild but i 'm like where have i seen this before i had just seen the movie evita with madonna and i 'm like you know what i 've got to do one about steve jobs
it won 't be easy you 'll think i 'm strange
when i try to explain why i 'm back after telling the press apple 's future is black
you won 't believe me
all that you see is a kid in his teens who started out in a garage with only a buddy named woz
you try rhyming with garage
don 't cry for me cupertino
the truth is i never left you
i know the ropes now know what the tricks are
i made a fortune over at pixar
don 't cry for me cupertino i 've still got the drive and vision
i still wear sandals in any weather it 's just that these days they 're gucci leather
thank you so steve jobs had always believed in simplicity and elegance and beauty and the truth is for years i was a little depressed because americans obviously did not value it because the mac had three percent market share and windows had 95 percent market share
people did not think it was worth putting a price on it
so i was a little depressed then i heard al gore 's talk and i realized i didn 't know the meaning of depressed
but it turns out i was wrong right because the ipod came out and it violated every bit of common wisdom
other products cost less other products had more features
they had voice recorders and fm transmitters
the other products were backed by microsoft with an open standard not apple 's propriety standard
but the ipod won this is the one they wanted
the lesson was simplicity sells
and there are signs that the industry is getting the message
this is a little company that 's done very well with simplicity and elegance
the sonos thing it 's catching on
i 've got just a couple examples physically a really cool elegant thinking coming along lately
when you have a digital camera how do you get the pictures back to your computer
well you either haul around a usb cable or you buy a card reader and haul that around
either one you 're going to lose what i do is i take out the memory card and i fold it in half revealing usb contacts
i just stick it in the computer offload the pictures put it right back in the camera i never have to lose anything
here 's another example chris you 're the source of all power
will you be my power plug
oh yeah
dp hold that and don 't let go you might have seen this this is apple 's new laptop this is the power cord it hooks on like this
and i 'm sure every one of you has done this at some point in your lives or one of your children you walk along and i 'm about to pull this onto the floor i don 't care it 's a loaner
here we go whoa it 's magnetic it doesn 't pull the laptop onto the floor
in my very last example i do a lot of my work using speech recognition software and you have to be kind of quiet because the software is nervous
speech recognition software is really great for doing emails very quickly period
like i get hundreds of them a day period
and it 's not just what i dictate that it writes down period
i also use this feature called voice macros period
correct dissuade not just
okay this is not an ideal situation because it 's getting the echo from the hall and stuff
but the point is i can respond to people very quickly by saying a short word and having it write out a much longer thing so if somebody sends me a fan letter i 'll say thanks for that
and conversely if somebody sends me hate mail which happens daily i say piss off
so that 's my dirty little secret don 't tell anyone
so the point is this a really interesting story
this is version eight of this software and do you know what they put in version eight
no new features it 's never happened before in software
the company put no new features they just said we 'll make the software work right right
because for years people had bought this software tried it out 95 percent accuracy was all they got which means one in 20 words is wrong and they put it in their drawer and the company got sick of that so they said this version we 're not going to do anything but make sure it 's darned accurate
and so that 's what they did this cult of doing things right is starting to spread
my final advice for those of you who are consumers of this technology remember if it doesn 't work it 's not necessarily you ok
it could be the design of the thing you 're using
be aware in life of good design and bad design
and if you 're among the people who create the stuff easy is hard
pre-sweat the details for your audience count the taps
remember the hard part is not deciding what features to add it 's deciding what to leave out
and best of all your motivation is simplicity sells
bravo
dp thank you very much
hear hear
like many of you i 'm one of the lucky people
i was born to a family where education was pervasive
i 'm a third-generation phd a daughter of two academics
in my childhood i played around in my father 's university lab
so it was taken for granted that i attend some of the best universities which in turn opened the door to a world of opportunity
unfortunately most of the people in the world are not so lucky
in some parts of the world for example south africa education is just not readily accessible
in south africa the educational system was constructed in the days of apartheid for the white minority
and as a consequence today there is just not enough spots for the many more people who want and deserve a high quality education
that scarcity led to a crisis in january of this year at the university of johannesburg
there were a handful of positions left open from the standard admissions process and the night before they were supposed to open that for registration thousands of people lined up outside the gate in a line a mile long hoping to be first in line to get one of those positions
when the gates opened there was a stampede and 20 people were injured and one woman died
she was a mother who gave her life trying to get her son a chance at a better life
but even in parts of the world like the united states where education is available it might not be within reach
there has been much discussed in the last few years about the rising cost of health care
what might not be quite as obvious to people is that during that same period the cost of higher education tuition has been increasing at almost twice the rate for a total of 559 percent since 1985
this makes education unaffordable for many people
finally even for those who do manage to get the higher education the doors of opportunity might not open
only a little over half of recent college graduates in the united states who get a higher education actually are working in jobs that require that education
this of course is not true for the students who graduate from the top institutions but for many others they do not get the value for their time and their effort
tom friedman in his recent new york times article captured in the way that no one else could the spirit behind our effort
he said the big breakthroughs are what happen when what is suddenly possible meets what is desperately necessary
i 've talked about what 's desperately necessary
let 's talk about what 's suddenly possible
what 's suddenly possible was demonstrated by three big stanford classes each of which had an enrollment of 100,000 people or more
so to understand this let 's look at one of those classes the machine learning class offered by my colleague and cofounder andrew ng
andrew teaches one of the bigger stanford classes
it 's a machine learning class and it has 400 people enrolled every time it 's offered
when andrew taught the machine learning class to the general public it had 100,000 people registered
so to put that number in perspective for andrew to reach that same size audience by teaching a stanford class he would have to do that for 250 years
of course he 'd get really bored
so having seen the impact of this andrew and i decided that we needed to really try and scale this up to bring the best quality education to as many people as we could
so we formed coursera whose goal is to take the best courses from the best instructors at the best universities and provide it to everyone around the world for free
we currently have 43 courses on the platform from four universities across a range of disciplines and let me show you a little bit of an overview of what that looks like
robert ghrist welcome to calculus
ezekiel emanuel fifty million people are uninsured
scott page models help us design more effective institutions and policies
we get unbelievable segregation
scott klemmer so bush imagined that in the future you 'd wear a camera right in the center of your head
mitchell duneier mills wants the student of sociology to develop the quality of mind ...
rg hanging cable takes on the form of a hyperbolic cosine
nick parlante for each pixel in the image set the red to zero
paul offit ... vaccine allowed us to eliminate polio virus
dan jurafsky does lufthansa serve breakfast and san jose well that sounds funny
daphne koller so this is which coin you pick and this is the two tosses
andrew ng so in large-scale machine learning we 'd like to come up with computational ...
it turns out maybe not surprisingly that students like getting the best content from the best universities for free
since we opened the website in february we now have 640,000 students from 190 countries
we have 1.5 million enrollments 6 million quizzes in the 15 classes that have launched so far have been submitted and 14 million videos have been viewed
but it 's not just about the numbers it 's also about the people
whether it 's akash who comes from a small town in india and would never have access in this case to a stanford-quality course and would never be able to afford it
or jenny who is a single mother of two and wants to hone her skills so that she can go back and complete her master 's degree
or ryan who can 't go to school because his immune deficient daughter can 't be risked to have germs come into the house so he couldn 't leave the house
i 'm really glad to say recently we 've been in correspondence with ryan that this story had a happy ending
baby shannon you can see her on the left is doing much better now and ryan got a job by taking some of our courses
so what made these courses so different
after all online course content has been available for a while
what made it different was that this was real course experience
it started on a given day and then the students would watch videos on a weekly basis and do homework assignments
and these would be real homework assignments for a real grade with a real deadline
you can see the deadlines and the usage graph
these are the spikes showing that procrastination is global phenomenon
at the end of the course the students got a certificate
they could present that certificate to a prospective employer and get a better job and we know many students who did
some students took their certificate and presented this to an educational institution at which they were enrolled for actual college credit
so these students were really getting something meaningful for their investment of time and effort
let 's talk a little bit about some of the components that go into these courses
the first component is that when you move away from the constraints of a physical classroom and design content explicitly for an online format you can break away from for example the monolithic one-hour lecture
you can break up the material for example into these short modular units of eight to 12 minutes each of which represents a coherent concept
students can traverse this material in different ways depending on their background their skills or their interests
so for example some students might benefit from a little bit of preparatory material that other students might already have
other students might be interested in a particular enrichment topic that they want to pursue individually
so this format allows us to break away from the one-size-fits-all model of education and allows students to follow a much more personalized curriculum
of course we all know as educators that students don 't learn by sitting and passively watching videos
perhaps one of the biggest components of this effort is that we need to have students who practice with the material in order to really understand it
there 's been a range of studies that demonstrate the importance of this
this one that appeared in science last year for example demonstrates that even simple retrieval practice where students are just supposed to repeat what they already learned gives considerably improved results on various achievement tests down the line than many other educational interventions
we 've tried to build in retrieval practice into the platform as well as other forms of practice in many ways
for example even our videos are not just videos
every few minutes the video pauses and the students get asked a question
sp ... these four things prospect theory hyperbolic discounting status quo bias base rate bias they 're all well documented
so they 're all well documented deviations from rational behavior
so here the video pauses and the student types in the answer into the box and submits obviously they weren 't paying attention
so they get to try again and this time they got it right
there 's an optional explanation if they want
and now the video moves on to the next part of the lecture
this is a kind of simple question that i as an instructor might ask in class but when i ask that kind of a question in class 80 percent of the students are still scribbling the last thing i said 15 percent are zoned out on facebook and then there 's the smarty pants in the front row who blurts out the answer before anyone else has had a chance to think about it and i as the instructor am terribly gratified that somebody actually knew the answer
and so the lecture moves on before really most of the students have even noticed that a question had been asked
here every single student has to engage with the material
and of course these simple retrieval questions are not the end of the story
one needs to build in much more meaningful practice questions and one also needs to provide the students with feedback on those questions
now how do you grade the work of 100,000 students if you do not have 10,000 tas
the answer is you need to use technology to do it for you
now fortunately technology has come a long way and we can now grade a range of interesting types of homework
in addition to multiple choice and the kinds of short answer questions that you saw in the video we can also grade math mathematical expressions as well as mathematical derivations
we can grade models whether it 's financial models in a business class or physical models in a science or engineering class and we can grade some pretty sophisticated programming assignments
let me show you one that 's actually pretty simple but fairly visual
this is from stanford 's computer science 101 class and the students are supposed to color-correct that blurry red image
they 're typing their program into the browser and you can see they didn 't get it quite right lady liberty is still seasick
and so the student tries again and now they got it right and they 're told that and they can move on to the next assignment
this ability to interact actively with the material and be told when you 're right or wrong is really essential to student learning
now of course we cannot yet grade the range of work that one needs for all courses
specifically what 's lacking is the kind of critical thinking work that is so essential in such disciplines as the humanities the social sciences business and others
so we tried to convince for example some of our humanities faculty that multiple choice was not such a bad strategy
that didn 't go over really well
so we had to come up with a different solution
and the solution we ended up using is peer grading
it turns out that previous studies show like this one by saddler and good that peer grading is a surprisingly effective strategy for providing reproducible grades
it was tried only in small classes but there it showed for example that these student-assigned grades on the y-axis are actually very well correlated with the teacher-assigned grade on the x-axis
what 's even more surprising is that self-grades where the students grade their own work critically so long as you incentivize them properly so they can 't give themselves a perfect score are actually even better correlated with the teacher grades
and so this is an effective strategy that can be used for grading at scale and is also a useful learning strategy for the students because they actually learn from the experience
so we now have the largest peer-grading pipeline ever devised where tens of thousands of students are grading each other 's work and quite successfully i have to say
but this is not just about students sitting alone in their living room working through problems
around each one of our courses a community of students had formed a global community of people around a shared intellectual endeavor
what you see here is a self-generated map from students in our princeton sociology 101 course where they have put themselves on a world map and you can really see the global reach of this kind of effort
students collaborated in these courses in a variety of different ways
first of all there was a question and answer forum where students would pose questions and other students would answer those questions
and the really amazing thing is because there were so many students it means that even if a student posed a question at 3 o 'clock in the morning somewhere around the world there would be somebody who was awake and working on the same problem
and so in many of our courses the median response time for a question on the question and answer forum was 22 minutes
which is not a level of service i have ever offered to my stanford students
and you can see from the student testimonials that students actually find that because of this large online community they got to interact with each other in many ways that were deeper than they did in the context of the physical classroom
students also self-assembled without any kind of intervention from us into small study groups
some of these were physical study groups along geographical constraints and met on a weekly basis to work through problem sets
this is the san francisco study group but there were ones all over the world
others were virtual study groups sometimes along language lines or along cultural lines and on the bottom left there you see our multicultural universal study group where people explicitly wanted to connect with people from other cultures
there are some tremendous opportunities to be had from this kind of framework
the first is that it has the potential of giving us a completely unprecedented look into understanding human learning
because the data that we can collect here is unique
you can collect every click every homework submission every forum post from tens of thousands of students
so you can turn the study of human learning from the hypothesis-driven mode to the data-driven mode a transformation that for example has revolutionized biology
you can use these data to understand fundamental questions like what are good learning strategies that are effective versus ones that are not
and in the context of particular courses you can ask questions like what are some of the misconceptions that are more common and how do we help students fix them
so here 's an example of that also from andrew 's machine learning class
this is a distribution of wrong answers to one of andrew 's assignments
the answers happen to be pairs of numbers so you can draw them on this two-dimensional plot
each of the little crosses that you see is a different wrong answer
the big cross at the top left is where 2,000 students gave the exact same wrong answer
now if two students in a class of 100 give the same wrong answer you would never notice
but when 2,000 students give the same wrong answer it 's kind of hard to miss
so andrew and his students went in looked at some of those assignments understood the root cause of the misconception and then they produced a targeted error message that would be provided to every student whose answer fell into that bucket which means that students who made that same mistake would now get personalized feedback telling them how to fix their misconception much more effectively
so this personalization is something that one can then build by having the virtue of large numbers
personalization is perhaps one of the biggest opportunities here as well because it provides us with the potential of solving a 30-year-old problem
educational researcher benjamin bloom in 1984 posed what 's called the 2 sigma problem which he observed by studying three populations
the first is the population that studied in a lecture-based classroom
the second is a population of students that studied using a standard lecture-based classroom but with a mastery-based approach so the students couldn 't move on to the next topic before demonstrating mastery of the previous one
and finally there was a population of students that were taught in a one-on-one instruction using a tutor
the mastery-based population was a full standard deviation or sigma in achievement scores better than the standard lecture-based class and the individual tutoring gives you 2 sigma improvement in performance
to understand what that means let 's look at the lecture-based classroom and let 's pick the median performance as a threshold
so in a lecture-based class half the students are above that level and half are below
in the individual tutoring instruction 98 percent of the students are going to be above that threshold
imagine if we could teach so that 98 percent of our students would be above average
hence the 2 sigma problem
because we cannot afford as a society to provide every student with an individual human tutor
but maybe we can afford to provide each student with a computer or a smartphone
so the question is how can we use technology to push from the left side of the graph from the blue curve to the right side with the green curve
mastery is easy to achieve using a computer because a computer doesn 't get tired of showing you the same video five times
and it doesn 't even get tired of grading the same work multiple times we 've seen that in many of the examples that i 've shown you
and even personalization is something that we 're starting to see the beginnings of whether it 's via the personalized trajectory through the curriculum or some of the personalized feedback that we 've shown you
so the goal here is to try and push and see how far we can get towards the green curve
so if this is so great are universities now obsolete
well mark twain certainly thought so
he said that college is a place where a professor 's lecture notes go straight to the students lecture notes without passing through the brains of either
i beg to differ with mark twain though
i think what he was complaining about is not universities but rather the lecture-based format that so many universities spend so much time on
so let 's go back even further to plutarch who said that the mind is not a vessel that needs filling but wood that needs igniting
and maybe we should spend less time at universities filling our students minds with content by lecturing at them and more time igniting their creativity their imagination and their problem-solving skills by actually talking with them
so how do we do that
we do that by doing active learning in the classroom
so there 's been many studies including this one that show that if you use active learning interacting with your students in the classroom performance improves on every single metric on attendance on engagement and on learning as measured by a standardized test
you can see for example that the achievement score almost doubles in this particular experiment
so maybe this is how we should spend our time at universities
so to summarize if we could offer a top quality education to everyone around the world for free what would that do three things
first it would establish education as a fundamental human right where anyone around the world with the ability and the motivation could get the skills that they need to make a better life for themselves their families and their communities
second it would enable lifelong learning
it 's a shame that for so many people learning stops when we finish high school or when we finish college
by having this amazing content be available we would be able to learn something new every time we wanted whether it 's just to expand our minds or it 's to change our lives
and finally this would enable a wave of innovation because amazing talent can be found anywhere
maybe the next albert einstein or the next steve jobs is living somewhere in a remote village in africa
and if we could offer that person an education they would be able to come up with the next big idea and make the world a better place for all of us
thank you very much
i 'm going to tell you a little bit about my tedxhouston talk
i woke up the morning after i gave that talk with the worst vulnerability hangover of my life
and i actually didn 't leave my house for about three days
the first time i left was to meet a friend for lunch
and when i walked in she was already at the table
and i sat down and she said god you look like hell
i said thanks i feel really i 'm not functioning
and she said what 's going on
and i said i just told 500 people that i became a researcher to avoid vulnerability
and that when being vulnerable emerged from my data as absolutely essential to whole-hearted living i told these 500 people that i had a breakdown
i had a slide that said breakdown
at what point did i think that was a good idea
and she said i saw your talk live-streamed
it was not really you
it was a little different than what you usually do
but it was great
and i said this can 't happen
youtube they 're putting this thing on youtube
and we 're going to be talking about 600 700 people
and she said well i think it 's too late
and i said let me ask you something
and she said yeah
and i said do you remember when we were in college and really wild and kind of dumb
and she said yeah
and i said remember when we 'd leave a really bad message on our ex-boyfriend 's answering machine
then we 'd have to break into his dorm room and then erase the tape
and she goes uh ... no
so of course the only thing i could think of to say at that point was yeah me neither
that ... me neither
and i 'm thinking to myself brene what are you doing what are you doing
why did you bring this up have you lost your mind
your sisters would be perfect for this
so i looked back up and she said are you really going to try to break in and steal the video before they put it on youtube
and i said i 'm just thinking about it a little bit
she said you 're like the worst vulnerability role model ever
and then i looked at her and i said something that at the time felt a little dramatic but ended up being more prophetic than dramatic
i said if 500 turns into 1,000 or 2,000 my life is over
i had no contingency plan for four million
and my life did end when that happened
and maybe the hardest part about my life ending is that i learned something hard about myself and that was that as much as i would frustrated about not being able to get my work out to the world there was a part of me that was working very hard to engineer staying small staying right under the radar
but i want to talk about what i 've learned
there 's two things that i 've learned in the last year
the first is vulnerability is not weakness
and that myth is profoundly dangerous
let me ask you honestly and i 'll give you this warning i 'm trained as a therapist so i can out-wait you uncomfortably so if you could just raise your hand that would be awesome how many of you honestly when you 're thinking about doing something vulnerable or saying something vulnerable think god vulnerability 's weakness this is weakness
how many of you think of vulnerability and weakness synonymously
the majority of people
now let me ask you this question this past week at ted how many of you when you saw vulnerability up here thought it was pure courage
vulnerability is not weakness
i define vulnerability as emotional risk exposure uncertainty
it fuels our daily lives
and i 've come to the belief this is my 12th year doing this research that vulnerability is our most accurate measurement of courage to be vulnerable to let ourselves be seen to be honest
one of the weird things that 's happened is after the ted explosion i got a lot of offers to speak all over the country everyone from schools and parent meetings to fortune 500 companies
and so many of the calls went like this hey dr. brown we loved your tedtalk
we 'd like you to come in and speak
we 'd appreciate it if you wouldn 't mention vulnerability or shame
what would you like for me to talk about
there 's three big answers
this is mostly to be honest with you from the business sector innovation creativity and change
so let me go on the record and say vulnerability is the birthplace of innovation creativity and change
to create is to make something that has never existed before
there 's nothing more vulnerable than that
adaptability to change is all about vulnerability
the second thing in addition to really finally understanding the relationship between vulnerability and courage the second thing i learned is this we have to talk about shame
and i 'm going to be really honest with you
when i became a vulnerability researcher and that became the focus because of the tedtalk and i 'm not kidding
i 'll give you an example
about three months ago i was in a sporting goods store buying goggles and shin guards and all the things that parents buy at the sporting goods store
about from a hundred feet away this is what i hear vulnerability ted vulnerability ted
i 'm a fifth generation texan
our family motto is lock and load
i am not a natural vulnerability researcher
so i 'm like just keep walking she 's on my six
and then i hear vulnerability ted
i turn around i go hi
she 's right here and she said you 're the shame researcher who had the breakdown
at this point parents are like pulling their children close
look away
and i 'm so worn out at this point in my life i look at her and i actually say it was a frickin spiritual awakening
and she looks back and does this i know
and she said we watched your tedtalk in my book club
then we read your book and we renamed ourselves the breakdown babes and she said our tagline is we 're falling apart and it feels fantastic you can only imagine what it 's like for me in a faculty meeting
so when i became vulnerability ted like an action figure like ninja barbie but i 'm vulnerability ted i thought i 'm going to leave that shame stuff behind because i spent six years studying shame before i really started writing and talking about vulnerability
and i thought thank god because shame is this horrible topic no one wants to talk about it
it 's the best way to shut people down on an airplane
what do you do i study shame oh
and i see you
but in surviving this last year i was reminded of a cardinal rule not a research rule but a moral imperative from my upbringing you 've got to dance with the one who brung ya
and i did not learn about vulnerability and courage and creativity and innovation from studying vulnerability
i learned about these things from studying shame
and so i want to walk you in to shame
jungian analysts call shame the swampland of the soul
and we 're going to walk in
and the purpose is not to walk in and construct a home and live there
it is to put on some galoshes and walk through and find our way around
here 's why
we heard the most compelling call ever to have a conversation in this country and i think globally around race right
yes we heard that
yes
cannot have that conversation without shame because you cannot talk about race without talking about privilege
and when people start talking about privilege they get paralyzed by shame
we heard a brilliant simple solution to not killing people in surgery which is have a checklist
you can 't fix that problem without addressing shame because when they teach those folks how to suture they also teach them how to stitch their self-worth to being all-powerful
and all-powerful folks don 't need checklists
and i had to write down the name of this ted fellow so i didn 't mess it up here
myshkin ingawale i hope i did right by you
i saw the ted fellows my first day here
and he got up and he explained how he was driven to create some technology to help test for anemia because people were dying unnecessarily
and he said i saw this need
so you know what i did i made it
and everybody just burst into applause and they were like yes
and he said and it didn 't work
and then i made it 32 more times and then it worked
you know what the big secret about ted is
i can 't wait to tell people this
i guess i 'm doing it right now
this is like the failure conference
no it is
you know why this place is amazing
because very few people here are afraid to fail
and no one who gets on the stage so far that i 've seen has not failed
i 've failed miserably many times
i don 't think the world understands that because of shame
there 's a great quote that saved me this past year by theodore roosevelt
a lot of people refer to it as the man in the arena quote
and it goes like this it is not the critic who counts
it is not the man who sits and points out how the doer of deeds could have done things better and how he falls and stumbles
the credit goes to the man in the arena whose face is marred with dust and blood and sweat
but when he 's in the arena at best he wins and at worst he loses but when he fails when he loses he does so daring greatly
and that 's what this conference to me is about
that 's what life is about about daring greatly about being in the arena
when you walk up to that arena and you put your hand on the door and you think i 'm going in and i 'm going to try this shame is the gremlin who says uh uh
you 're not good enough
you never finished that mba your wife left you
i know your dad really wasn 't in luxembourg he was in sing sing
i know those things that happened to you growing up
i know you don 't think that you 're pretty enough or smart enough or talented enough or powerful enough
i know your dad never paid attention even when you made cfo
shame is that thing
and if we can quiet it down and walk in and say i 'm going to do this we look up and the critic that we see pointing and laughing 99 percent of the time is who
us
shame drives two big tapes never good enough and if you can talk it out of that one who do you think you are
the thing to understand about shame is it 's not guilt
shame is a focus on self guilt is a focus on behavior
shame is i am bad
guilt is i did something bad
how many of you if you did something that was hurtful to me would be willing to say i 'm sorry i made a mistake
how many of you would be willing to say that
guilt i 'm sorry i made a mistake
shame i 'm sorry i am a mistake
there 's a huge difference between shame and guilt
and here 's what you need to know
shame is highly highly correlated with addiction depression violence aggression bullying suicide eating disorders
and here 's what you even need to know more
guilt inversely correlated with those things
the ability to hold something we 've done or failed to do up against who we want to be is incredibly adaptive
it 's uncomfortable but it 's adaptive
the other thing you need to know about shame is it 's absolutely organized by gender
if shame washes over me and washes over chris it 's going to feel the same
everyone sitting in here knows the warm wash of shame
we 're pretty sure that the only people who don 't experience shame are people who have no capacity for connection or empathy
which means yes i have a little shame no i 'm a sociopath
so i would opt for yes you have a little shame
shame feels the same for men and women but it 's organized by gender
for women the best example i can give you is enjoli the commercial i can put the wash on the line pack the lunches hand out the kisses and be at work at five to nine
i can bring home the bacon fry it up in the pan and never let you forget you 're a man
for women shame is do it all do it perfectly and never let them see you sweat
i don 't know how much perfume that commercial sold but i guarantee you it moved a lot of antidepressants and anti-anxiety meds
shame for women is this web of unobtainable conflicting competing expectations about who we 're supposed to be
and it 's a straight-jacket
for men shame is not a bunch of competing conflicting expectations
shame is one do not be perceived as what
weak
i did not interview men for the first four years of my study
and it wasn 't until a man looked at me one day after a book signing said i love what you have to say about shame i 'm curious why you didn 't mention men
and i said i don 't study men
and he said that 's convenient
and i said why
and he said because you say to reach out tell our story be vulnerable
but you see those books you just signed for my wife and my three daughters
i said yeah
they 'd rather me die on top of my white horse than watch me fall down
when we reach out and be vulnerable we get the shit beat out of us
and don 't tell me it 's from the guys and the coaches and the dads because the women in my life are harder on me than anyone else
so i started interviewing men and asking questions
and what i learned is this you show me a woman who can actually sit with a man in real vulnerability and fear i 'll show you a woman who 's done incredible work
you show me a man who can sit with a woman who 's just had it she can 't do it all anymore and his first response is not i unloaded the dishwasher but he really listens because that 's all we need i 'll show you a guy who 's done a lot of work
shame is an epidemic in our culture
and to get out from underneath it to find our way back to each other we have to understand how it affects us and how it affects the way we 're parenting the way we 're working the way we 're looking at each other
very quickly some research by mahalik at boston college
he asked what do women need to do to conform to female norms
the top answers in this country nice thin modest and use all available resources for appearance
when he asked about men what do men in this country need to do to conform with male norms the answers were always show emotional control work is first pursue status and violence
if we 're going to find our way back to each other we have to understand and know empathy because empathy 's the antidote to shame
if you put shame in a petri dish it needs three things to grow exponentially secrecy silence and judgment
if you put the same amount of shame in a petri dish and douse it with empathy it can 't survive
the two most powerful words when we 're in struggle me too
and so i 'll leave you with this thought
if we 're going to find our way back to each other vulnerability is going to be that path
and i know it 's seductive to stand outside the arena because i think i did it my whole life and think to myself i 'm going to go in there and kick some ass when i 'm bulletproof and when i 'm perfect
and that is seductive
but the truth is that never happens
and even if you got as perfect as you could and as bulletproof as you could possibly muster when you got in there that 's not what we want to see
we want you to go in
we want to be with you and across from you
and we just want for ourselves and the people we care about and the people we work with to dare greatly
so thank you all very much i really appreciate it
in 1975 i met in florence a professor carlo pedretti my former professor of art history and today a world-renowned scholar of leonardo da vinci
well he asked me if i could find some technological way to unfold a five-centuries-old mystery related to a lost masterpiece by leonardo da vinci the battle of anghiari which is supposed to be located in the hall of the 500 in palazzo vecchio in florence
well in the mid- 70s there were not great opportunities for a bioengineer like me especially in italy and so i decided with some researchers from the united states and the university of florence to start probing the murals decorated by vasari on the long walls of the hall of the 500 searching for the lost leonardo
unfortunately at that time we did not know that that was not exactly where we should be looking because we had to go much deeper in and so the research came to a halt and it was only taken up in 2000 thanks to the interest and the enthusiasm of the guinness family
well this time we focused on trying to reconstruct the way the hall of the 500 was before the remodeling and the so-called sala grande which was built in 1494 and to find out the original doors windows and in order to do that we first created a 3d model and then with thermography we went on to discover hidden windows these are the original windows of the hall of the sala grande we also found out about the height of the ceiling and we managed to reconstruct therefore all the layout of this original hall the way it was before there came vasari and restructured the whole thing including a staircase that was very important in order to precisely place the battle of anghiari on a specific area of one of the two walls
well we also learned that vasari who was commissioned to remodel the hall of the 500 between 1560 and 1574 by the grand duke cosimo i of the medici family we have at least two instances when he saved masterpieces specifically by placing a brick wall in front of it and leaving a small air gap
one that we [ see ] here masaccio the church of santa maria novella in florence so we just said well maybe visari has done something like that in the case of this great work of art by leonardo since he was a great admirer of leonardo da vinci
and so we built some very sophisticated radio antennas just for probing both walls and searching for an air gap
and we did find many on the right panel of the east wall an air gap and that 's where we believe the battle of anghiari or at least the part that we know has been painted which is called the fight for the standard should be located
well from there unfortunately in 2004 the project came to a halt many political reasons
so i decided to go back to my alma mater and at the university of california san diego and i proposed to open up a research center for engineering sciences for cultural heritage
and in 2007 we created cisa3 as a research center for cultural heritage specifically art architecture and archaeology so students started to flow in and we started to build technologies because that 's basically what we also needed in order to move forward and go and do fieldwork
we came back in the hall of the 500 in 2011 and this time with a great group of students and my colleague professor falko kuester who is now the director at cisa3 and we came back just since we knew already where to look for to find out if there was still something left
well we were confined though limited i should rather say for several reasons that it 's not worth explaining to endoscopy only of the many other options we had and with a 4mm camera attached to it we were successful in documenting and taking some fragments of what it turns out to be a reddish color black color and there is some beige fragments that later on we ran a much more sophisticated exams xrf x-ray diffraction and the results are very positive so far it seems to indicate that indeed we have found some pigments and since we know for sure that no other artist has painted on that wall before vasari came in about 60 years later well those pigments are therefore firmly related to mural painting and most likely to leonardo
well we are searching for the highest and highly praised work of art ever achieved by mankind
as a matter of fact this is by far the most important commission that leonardo has ever had and for doing this great masterpiece he was named the number one artist influence at the time
i had also had the privilege since the last 37 years to work on several masterpieces as you can see behind me but basically to do what well to assess for example the state of conservation see here the face of the madonna of the chair that when just shining a uv light on it you suddenly see another different lady aged lady i should rather say
there is a lot of varnish still sitting there several retouches and some over cleaning it becomes very visible
but also technology has helped to write new pages of our history or at least to update pages of our histories
for example the lady with the unicorn another painting by rafael well you see the unicorn
a lot has been said and written about the unicorn but if you take an x-ray of the unicorn it becomes a puppy dog
and no problem but unfortunately continuing with the scientific examination of this painting came out that rafael did not paint the unicorn did not paint the puppy dog actually left the painting unfinished so all this writing about the exotic symbol of the unicorn unfortunately is not very reliable
well also authenticity just think for a moment if science really could move in the field of authenticity of works of art there would be a cultural revolution to say the least but also i would say a market revolution let me add take this example otto marseus nice painting which is still life at the pitti gallery and just have an infrared camera peering through and luckily for art historians it just was confirmed that there is a signature of otto marseus it even says when it was made and also the location
so that was a good result sometimes it 's not that good and so again authenticity and science could go together and change the way not attributions being made but at least lay the ground for a more objective or i should rather say less subjective attribution as it is done today
but i would say the discovery that really caught my imagination my admiration is the incredibly vivid drawing under this layer brown layer of the adoration of the magi here you see a handmade setting xyz scanner with an infrared camera put on it and just peering through this brown layer of this masterpiece to reveal what could have been underneath
well this happens to be the most important painting we have in italy by leonardo da vinci and look at the wonderful images of faces that nobody has seen for five centuries look at these portraits
they 're magnificent you see leonardo at work
you see the geniality of his creation right directly on the ground layer of the panel and see this cool thing finding i should rather say an elephant because of this elephant over 70 new images came out never seen for centuries
this was an epiphany we came to understand and to prove that the brown coating that we see today was not done by leonardo da vinci which left us only the other drawing that for five centuries we were not able to see so thanks only to technology
well the tablet well we thought well if we all have this pleasure this privilege to see all this to find all these discoveries what about for everybody else
so we thought of an augmented reality application using a tablet let me show you just simulating what we could be doing any of us could be doing in a museum environment
so let 's say that we go to a museum with a tablet okay
and we just aim the camera of the tablet to the painting that we are interested to see like this
okay and i will just click on it we pause and now let me turn to you so the moment the image or i should say the camera has locked in the painting then the images you just saw up there in the drawing are being loaded and so see
we can as we said we can zoom in then we can scroll
okay let 's go and find the elephant
so all we need is one finger just wipe off and we see the elephant
okay and then if we want we can continue the scroll to find out for example on the staircase the whole iconography is going to be changed there are a lot of laymen reconstructing from the ruins of an old temple a new temple and there are a lot of figures showing up see
this is not just a curiosity because it changes not just the iconography as you see it but the iconology the meaning of the painting and we believe this is a cool way easy way that everybody could have access to to become more the protagonist of your own discovery and not just be so passive about it as we are when we walk through endless rooms of museums
another concept is the digital clinical chart which sounds very obvious if we were to talk about real patients but when we talk about works of art unfortunately it 's never been tapped as an idea
well we believe again that this should be the beginning the very first step to do real conservation and allowing us to really explore and to understand everything related to the state of our conservation the technique materials and also if when and why we should restore or rather to intervene on the environment surrounding the painting
well our vision is to rediscover the spirit of the renaissance create a new discipline where engineering for cultural heritage is actually a symbol of blending art and science together
we definitely need a new breed of engineers that will go out and do this kind of work and rediscover for us these values these cultural values that we badly need especially today
and if you want to summarize in one just single word well this is what we 're trying to do
we 're trying to give a future to our past in order to have a future
as long as we live a life of curiosity and passion there is a bit of leonardo in all of us thank you
in 1991 i had maybe the most profound and transformative experience of my life
i was in the third year of my seven-year undergraduate degree
i took a couple victory laps in there
and i was on a college choir tour up in northern california and we had stopped for the day after all day on the bus and we were relaxing next to this beautiful idyllic lake in the mountains
and there were crickets and birds and frogs making noise and as we sat there over the mountains coming in from the north were these steven spielbergian clouds rolling toward us and as the clouds got about halfway over the valley so help me god every single animal in that place stopped making noise at the same time
this electric hush as if they could sense what was about to happen
and then the clouds came over us and then boom this massive thunderclap and sheets of rain
it was just extraordinary and when i came back home i found a poem by the mexican poet octavio paz and decided to set it to music a piece for choir called cloudburst which is the piece that we 'll perform for you in just a moment
now fast forward to just three years ago
and we released to youtube this the virtual choir project 185 singers from 12 different countries
you can see my little video there conducting these people alone in their dorm rooms or in their living rooms at home
two years ago on this very stage we premiered virtual choir 2 2,052 singers from 58 different countries this time performing a piece that i had written called sleep
and then just last spring we released virtual choir 3 water night another piece that i had written this time nearly 4,000 singers from 73 different countries
and when i was speaking to chris about the future of virtual choir and where we might be able to take this he challenged me to push the technology as far as we possibly could
could we do this all in real time
could we have people singing together in real time
and with the help of skype that is what we are going to attempt today
now we 'll perform cloudburst for you
the first half will be performed by the live singers here on stage
i 'm joined by singers from cal state long beach cal state fullerton and riverside community college some of the best amateur choirs in the country and and in the second half of the piece the virtual choir will join us 30 different singers from 30 different countries
now we 've pushed the technology as far as it can go but there 's still less than a second of latency but in musical terms that 's a lifetime
we deal in milliseconds
so what i 've done is i 've adapted cloudburst so that it embraces the latency and the performers sing into the latency instead of trying to be exactly together
so with deep humility and for your approval we present cloudburst

thank you
hi i 'm here to talk to you about the importance of praise admiration and thank you and having it be specific and genuine
and the way i got interested in this was i noticed in myself when i was growing up and until about a few years ago that i would want to say thank you to someone i would want to praise them i would want to take in their praise of me and i 'd just stop it
and i asked myself why
i felt shy i felt embarrassed
and then my question became am i the only one who does this
so i decided to investigate
i 'm fortunate enough to work in the rehab facility so i get to see people who are facing life and death with addiction
and sometimes it comes down to something as simple as their core wound is their father died without ever saying he 's proud of them
but then they hear from all the family and friends that the father told everybody else that he was proud of him but he never told the son
it 's because he didn 't know that his son needed to hear it
so my question is why don 't we ask for the things that we need
i know a gentleman married for 25 years who 's longing to hear his wife say thank you for being the breadwinner so i can stay home with the kids but won 't ask
i know a woman who 's good at this
she once a week meets with her husband and says i 'd really like you to thank me for all these things i did in the house and with the kids
and he goes oh this is great this is great
and praise really does have to be genuine but she takes responsibility for that
and a friend of mine april who i 've had since kindergarten she thanks her children for doing their chores
and she said why wouldn 't i thank it even though they 're supposed to do it
so the question is why was i blocking it
why were other people blocking it
why can i say i 'll take my steak medium rare i need size six shoes but i won 't say would you praise me this way
and it 's because i 'm giving you critical data about me
i 'm telling you where i 'm insecure
i 'm telling you where i need your help
and i 'm treating you my inner circle like you 're the enemy
because what can you do with that data
you could neglect me
you could abuse it
or you could actually meet my need
and i took my bike into the bike store-- i love this same bike and they 'd do something called truing the wheels
the guy said you know when you true the wheels it 's going to make the bike so much better
i get the same bike back and they 've taken all the little warps out of those same wheels i 've had for two and a half years and my bike is like new
so i 'm going to challenge all of you
i want you to true your wheels be honest about the praise that you need to hear
what do you need to hear go home to your wife go ask her what does she need
go home to your husband what does he need
go home and ask those questions and then help the people around you
and it 's simple
and why should we care about this
we talk about world peace
how can we have world peace with different cultures different languages
i think it starts household by household under the same roof
so let 's make it right in our own backyard
and i want to thank all of you in the audience for being great husbands great mothers friends daughters sons
and maybe somebody 's never said that to you but you 've done a really really good job
and thank you for being here just showing up and changing the world with your ideas
thank you

it 's a great honor today to share with you the digital universe which was created for humanity to really see where we are in the universe
and so i think we can roll the video that we have
[ the himalayas ] the flat horizon that we 've evolved with has been a metaphor for the infinite unbounded resources and unlimited capacity for disposal of waste
it wasn 't until we really left earth got above the atmosphere and had seen the horizon bend back on itself that we could understand our planet as a limited condition
the digital universe atlas has been built at the american museum of natural history over the past 12 years
we maintain that put that together as a project to really chart the universe across all scales
what we see here are satellites around the earth and the earth in proper registration against the universe as we see
nasa supported this work 12 years ago as part of the rebuilding of the hayden planetarium so that we would share this with the world
the digital universe is the basis of our space show productions that we do our main space shows in the dome
but what you see here is the result of actually internships that we hosted with linkoping university in sweden
i 've had 12 students work on this for their graduate work and the result has been this software called uniview and a company called sciss in sweden
this software allows interactive use so this actual flight path and movie that we see here was actually flown live
i captured this live from my laptop in a cafe called earth matters on the lower east side of manhattan where i live and it was done as a collaborative project with the rubin museum of himalayan art for an exhibit on comparative cosmology
and so as we move out we see continuously from our planet all the way out into the realm of galaxies as we see here light-travel time giving you a sense of how far away we are
as we move out the light from these distant galaxies have taken so long we 're essentially backing up into the past
we back so far up we 're finally seeing a containment around us the afterglow of the big bang
this is the wmap microwave background that we see
we 'll fly outside it here just to see this sort of containment
if we were outside this it would almost be meaningless in the sense as before time
but this our containment of the visible universe
we know the universe is bigger than that which we can see
coming back quickly we see here the radio sphere that we jumped out of in the beginning but these are positions the latest positions of exoplanets that we 've mapped and our sun here obviously with our own solar system
what you 're going to see we 're going to have to jump in here pretty quickly between several orders of magnitude to get down to where we see the solar system these are the paths of voyager 1 voyager 2 pioneer 11 and pioneer 10 the first four spacecraft to have left the solar system
coming in closer picking up earth orbit of the moon and we see the earth
this map can be updated and we can add in new data
i know dr. carolyn porco is the camera p.i.
for the cassini mission
but here we see the complex trajectory of the cassini mission color coded for different mission phases ingeniously developed so that 45 encounters with the largest moon titan which is larger that the planet mercury diverts the orbit into different parts of mission phase
this software allows us to come close and look at parts of this
this software can also be networked between domes
we have a growing user base of this and we network domes
and we can network between domes and classrooms
we 're actually sharing tours of the universe with the first sub-saharan planetarium in ghana as well as new libraries that have been built in the ghettos in columbia and a high school in cambodia
and the cambodians have actually controlled the hayden planetarium from their high school
this is an image from saturday photographed by the aqua satellite but through the uniview software
so you 're seeing the edge of the earth
this is nepal
this is in fact right here is the valley of lhasa right here in tibet
but we can see the haze from fires and so forth in the ganges valley down below in india
this is nepal and tibet
and just in closing i 'd just like to say this beautiful world that we live on here we see a bit of the snow that some of you may have had to brave in coming out so i 'd like to just say that what the world needs now is a sense of being able to look at ourselves in this much larger condition now and a much larger sense of what home is
because our home is the universe and we are the universe essentially
we carry that in us
and to be able to see our context in this larger sense at all scales helps us all i think in understanding where we are and who we are in the universe
thank you
so why does good sex so often fade even for couples who continue to love each other as much as ever
and why does good intimacy not guarantee good sex contrary to popular belief
or the next question would be can we want what we already have
that 's the million-dollar question right
and why is the forbidden so erotic
what is it about transgression that makes desire so potent
and why does sex make babies and babies spell erotic disaster in couples
it 's kind of the fatal erotic blow isn 't it
and when you love how does it feel
and when you desire how is it different
these are some of the questions that are at the center of my exploration on the nature of erotic desire and its concomitant dilemmas in modern love
so i travel the globe and what i 'm noticing is that everywhere where romanticism has entered there seems to be a crisis of desire
a crisis of desire as in owning the wanting desire as an expression of our individuality of our free choice of our preferences of our identity desire that has become a central concept as part of modern love and individualistic societies
you know this is the first time in the history of humankind where we are trying to experience sexuality in the long term not because we want 14 children for which we need to have even more because many of them won 't make it and not because it is exclusively a woman 's marital duty
this is the first time that we want sex over time about pleasure and connection that is rooted in desire
so what sustains desire and why is it so difficult
and at the heart of sustaining desire in a committed relationship i think is the reconciliation of two fundamental human needs
on the one hand our need for security for predictability for safety for dependability for reliability for permanence all these anchoring grounding experiences of our lives that we call home
but we also have an equally strong need men and women for adventure for novelty for mystery for risk for danger for the unknown for the unexpected surprise you get the gist for journey for travel
so reconciling our need for security and our need for adventure into one relationship or what we today like to call a passionate marriage used to be a contradiction in terms
marriage was an economic institution in which you were given a partnership for life in terms of children and social status and succession and companionship
but now we want our partner to still give us all these things but in addition i want you to be my best friend and my trusted confidant and my passionate lover to boot and we live twice as long
so we come to one person and we basically are asking them to give us what once an entire village used to provide give me belonging give me identity give me continuity but give me transcendence and mystery and awe all in one
give me comfort give me edge
give me novelty give me familiarity
give me predictability give me surprise
and we think it 's a given and toys and lingerie are going to save us with that
so now we get to the existential reality of the story right
because i think in some way and i 'll come back to that but the crisis of desire is often a crisis of the imagination
so why does good sex so often fade
what is the relationship between love and desire
how do they relate and how do they conflict
because therein lies the mystery of eroticism
so if there is a verb for me that comes with love it 's to have
and if there is a verb that comes with desire it is to want
in love we want to have we want to know the beloved
we want to minimize the distance we want to contract that gap
we want to neutralize the tensions we want closeness
but in desire we tend to not really want to go back to the places we 've already gone
forgone conclusion does not keep our interest
in desire we want an other somebody on the other side that we can go visit that we can go spend some time with that we can go see what goes on in their red light district
in desire we want a bridge to cross
or in other words i sometimes say fire needs air
desire needs space
and when it 's said like that it 's often quite abstract
but then i took a question with me
and i 've gone to more than 20 countries in the last few years with mating in captivity and i asked people when do you find yourself most drawn to your partner
not attracted sexually per se but most drawn
and across culture across religion and across gender except for one there are a few answers that just keep coming back
so the first group is i am most drawn to my partner when she is away when we are apart when we reunite
basically when i get back in touch with my ability to imagine myself with my partner when my imagination comes back in the picture and when i can root it in absence and in longing which is a major component of desire
but then the second group is even more interesting i am most drawn to my partner when i see him in the studio when she is onstage when he is in his element when she 's doing something she 's passionate about when i see him at a party and other people are really drawn to him when i see her hold court
basically when i look at my partner radiant and confident probably the biggest turn-on across the board
radiant as in self-sustaining
i look at this person by the way in desire people rarely talk about it when we are blended into one five centimeters from each other i don 't know in inches how much that is
but it 's also not when the other person is that far apart that you no longer see them
it 's when i 'm looking at my partner from a comfortable distance where this person that is already so familiar so known is momentarily once again somewhat mysterious somewhat elusive
and in this space between me and the other lies the erotic élan lies that movement toward the other
because sometimes as proust says mystery is not about traveling to new places but it 's about looking with new eyes
and so when i see my partner on his own or her own doing something in which they are enveloped i look at this person and i momentarily get a shift in perception and i stay open to the mysteries that are living right next to me
and then more importantly in this description about the other or myself it 's the same what is most interesting is that there is no neediness in desire
nobody needs anybody
there is no caretaking in desire
caretaking is mightily loving it 's a powerful anti-aphrodisiac
i have yet to see somebody who is so turned on by somebody who needs them
wanting them is one thing needing them is a shutdown and women have known that forever because anything that will bring up parenthood will usually decrease the erotic charge
for good reasons right
and then the third group of answers usually would be when i 'm surprised when we laugh together as somebody said to me in the office today when he 's in his tux so i said you know it 's either the tux or the cowboy boots
but basically it 's when there is novelty
but novelty isn 't about new positions it isn 't a repertoire of techniques
novelty is what parts of you do you bring out
what parts of you are just being seen
because in some way one could say sex isn 't something you do eh
sex is a place you go it 's a space you enter inside yourself and with another or others
so where do you go in sex
what parts of you do you connect to
what do you seek to express there
is it a place for transcendence and spiritual union
is it a place for naughtiness and is it a place to be safely aggressive
is it a place where you can finally surrender and not have to take responsibility for everything
is it a place where you can express your infantile wishes
what comes out there it 's a language
it isn 't just a behavior
and it 's the poetic of that language that i 'm interested in which is why i began to explore this concept of erotic intelligence
you know animals have sex
it 's the pivot it 's biology it 's the natural instinct
we are the only ones who have an erotic life which means that it 's sexuality transformed by the human imagination
we are the only ones who can make love for hours have a blissful time multiple orgasms and touch nobody just because we can imagine it
we can hint at it we don 't even have to do it
we can experience that powerful thing called anticipation which is a mortar to desire the ability to imagine it as if it 's happening to experience it as if it 's happening while nothing is happening and everything is happening at the same time
so when i began to think about eroticism i began to think about the poetics of sex and if i look at it as an intelligence then it 's something that you cultivate
what are the ingredients imagination playfulness novelty curiosity mystery
but the central agent is really that piece called the imagination
but more importantly for me to begin to understand who are the couples who have an erotic spark what sustains desire i had to go back to the original definition of eroticism the mystical definition and i went through it through a bifurcation by looking actually at trauma which is the other side and i looked at it looking at the community that i had grown up in which was a community in belgium all holocaust survivors and in my community there were two groups those who didn 't die and those who came back to life
and those who didn 't die lived often very tethered to the ground could not experience pleasure could not trust because when you 're vigilant worried anxious and insecure you can 't lift your head to go and take off in space and be playful and safe and imaginative
those who came back to life were those who understood the erotic as an antidote to death
they knew how to keep themselves alive
and when i began to listen to the sexlessness of the couples that i work with i sometimes would hear people say i want more sex but generally people want better sex and better is to reconnect with that quality of aliveness of vibrancy of renewal of vitality of eros of energy that sex used to afford them or that they 've hoped it would afford them
and so i began to ask a different question
i shut myself off when ... began to be the question
i turn off my desires when ... which is not the same question as what turns me off is ... and you turn me off when ...
and people began to say i turn myself off when i feel dead inside when i don 't like my body when i feel old when i haven 't had time for myself when i haven 't had a chance to even check in with you when i don 't perform well at work when i feel low self esteem when i don 't have a sense of self-worth when i don 't feel like i have a right to want to take to receive pleasure
and then i began to ask the reverse question
i turn myself on when ... because most of the time people like to ask the question you turn me on what turns me on and i 'm out of the question you know
now if you are dead inside the other person can do a lot of things for valentine 's
it won 't make a dent there is nobody at the reception desk
so i turn myself on when i turn my desires i wake up when ...
now in this paradox between love and desire what seems to be so puzzling is that the very ingredients that nurture love mutuality reciprocity protection worry responsibility for the other are sometimes the very ingredients that stifle desire
because desire comes with a host of feelings that are not always such favorites of love jealousy possessiveness aggression power dominance naughtiness mischief
basically most of us will get turned on at night by the very same things that we will demonstrate against during the day
you know the erotic mind is not very politically correct
if everybody was fantasizing on a bed of roses we wouldn 't be having such interesting talks about this
but no in our mind up there are a host of things going on that we don 't always know how to bring to the person that we love because we think love comes with selflessness and in fact desire comes with a certain amount of selfishness in the best sense of the word the ability to stay connected to one 's self in the presence of another
so i want to draw that little image for you because this need to reconcile these two sets of needs we are born with that
our need for connection our need for separateness or our need for security and adventure or our need for togetherness and for autonomy and if you think about the little kid who sits on your lap and who is cozily nested here and very secure and comfortable and at some point all of us need to go out into the world to discover and to explore
that 's the beginning of desire that exploratory needs curiosity discovery
and then at some point they turn around and they look at you and if you tell them hey kiddo the world 's a great place go for it
there 's so much fun out there then they can turn away and they can experience connection and separateness at the same time
they can go off in their imagination off in their body off in their playfulness all the while knowing that there 's somebody when they come back
but if on this side there is somebody who says i 'm worried i 'm anxious i 'm depressed
my partner hasn 't taken care of me in so long
what 's so good out there don 't we have everything you need together you and i
then there are a few little reactions that all of us can pretty much recognize
some of us will come back came back a long time ago and that little child who comes back is the child who will forgo a part of himself in order not to lose the other
i will lose my freedom in order not to lose connection
and i will learn to love in a certain way that will become burdened with extra worry and extra responsibility and extra protection and i won 't know how to leave you in order to go play in order to go experience pleasure in order to discover to enter inside myself
translate this into adult language
it starts very young it continues into our sex lives up to the end
child number two comes back but looks like that over their shoulder all the time
are you going to be there
are you going to curse me are you going to scold me
are you going to be angry with me
and they may be gone but they 're never really away and those are often the people that will tell you in the beginning it was super hot
because in the beginning the growing intimacy wasn 't yet so strong that it actually led to the decrease of desire
the more connected i became the more responsible i felt the less i was able to let go in your presence
the third child doesn 't really come back
so what happens if you want to sustain desire it 's that real dialectic piece
on the one hand you want the security in order to be able to go
on the other hand if you can 't go you can 't have pleasure you can 't culminate you don 't have an orgasm you don 't get excited because you spend your time in the body and the head of the other and not in your own
so in this dilemma about reconciling these two sets of fundamental needs there are a few things that i 've come to understand erotic couples do
one they have a lot of sexual privacy
they understand that there is an erotic space that belongs to each of them
they also understand that foreplay is not something you do five minutes before the real thing
foreplay pretty much starts at the end of the previous orgasm
they also understand that an erotic space isn 't about you begin to stroke the other
it 's about you create a space where you leave management inc maybe where you leave the agile program and you actually just enter that place where you stop being the good citizen who is taking care of things and being responsible
responsibility and desire just butt heads
they don 't really do well together
erotic couples also understand that passion waxes and wanes
it 's pretty much like the moon it has intermittent eclipses
but what they know is they know how to resurrect it
they know how to bring it back and they know how to bring it back because they have demystified one big myth which is the myth of spontaneity which is that it 's just going to fall from heaven while you 're folding the laundry like a deus ex machina and in fact they understood that whatever is going to just happen in a long-term relationship already has
committed sex is premeditated sex
it 's willful it 's intentional
it 's focus and presence
merry valentine 's

trees epitomize stasis
trees are rooted in the ground in one place for many human generations but if we shift our perspective from the trunk to the twigs trees become very dynamic entities moving and growing
and i decided to explore this movement by turning trees into artists
i simply tied the end of a paintbrush onto a twig
i waited for the wind to come up and held up a canvas and that produced art
the piece of art you see on your left is painted by a western red cedar and that on your right by a douglas fir and what i learned was that different species have different signatures like a picasso versus a monet
but i was also interested in the movement of trees and how this art might let me capture that and quantify it so to measure the distance that a single vine maple tree which produced this painting moved in a single year i simply measured and summed each of those lines
i multiplied them by the number of twigs per branch and the number of branches per tree and then divided that by the number of minutes per year
and so i was able to calculate how far a single tree moved in a single year
you might have a guess
the answer is actually 186,540 miles or seven times around the globe
and so simply by shifting our perspective from a single trunk to the many dynamic twigs we are able to see that trees are not simply static entities but rather extremely dynamic
and i began to think about ways that we might consider this lesson of trees to consider other entities that are also static and stuck but which cry for change and dynamicism and one of those entities is our prisons
prisons of course are where people who break our laws are stuck confined behind bars
and our prison system itself is stuck
the united states has over 2.3 million incarcerated men and women
that number is rising
of the 100 incarcerated people that are released 60 will return to prison
funds for education for training and for rehabilitation are declining so this despairing cycle of incarceration continues
i decided to ask whether the lesson i had learned from trees as artists could be applied to a static institution such as our prisons and i think the answer is yes
in the year 2007 i started a partnership with the washington state department of corrections
working with four prisons we began bringing science and scientists sustainability and conservation projects to four state prisons
we give science lectures and the men here are choosing to come to our science lectures instead of watching television or weightlifting
that i think is movement
we partnered with the nature conservancy for inmates at stafford creek correctional center to grow endangered prairie plants for restoration of relic prairie areas in washington state
that i think is movement
we worked with the washington state department of fish and wildlife to grow endangered frogs the oregon spotted frog for later release into protected wetlands
that i think is movement
and just recently we 've begun to work with those men who are segregated in what we call supermax facilities
they 've incurred violent infractions by becoming violent with guards and with other prisoners
they 're kept in bare cells like this for 23 hours a day
when they have meetings with their review boards or mental health professionals they 're placed in immobile booths like this
for one hour a day they 're brought to these bleak and bland exercise yards
although we can 't bring trees and prairie plants and frogs into these environments we are bringing images of nature into these exercise yards putting them on the walls so at least they get contact with visual images of nature
this is mr. lopez who has been in solitary confinement for 18 months and he 's providing input on the types of images that he believes would make him and his fellow inmates more serene more calm less apt to violence
and so what we see i think is that small collective movements of change can perhaps move an entity such as our own prison system in a direction of hope
we know that trees are static entities when we look at their trunks
but if trees can create art if they can encircle the globe seven times in one year if prisoners can grow plants and raise frogs then perhaps there are other static entities that we hold inside ourselves like grief like addictions like racism that can also change
thank you very much
robbie mizzone thank you
tommy mizzone thank you very much
we 're so excited to be here it 's such an honor for us
like he said we 're three brothers from new jersey you know the bluegrass capital of the world
we discovered bluegrass a few years ago and we fell in love with it we hope you guys will too
this next song is an original we wrote called timelapse and it will probably live up to its name
tm thank you very much
rm i 'm just going to take a second to introduce the band
on guitar is my 15-year-old brother tommy
on banjo is 10-year-old jonny
he 's also our brother
and i 'm robbie and i 'm 14 and i play the fiddle
as you can see we decided to make it hard on ourselves and we chose to play three songs in three different keys
yeah i 'm also going to explain a lot of people want to know where we got the name sleepy man banjo boys from
so it started when jonny was little and he first started the banjo he would play on his back with his eyes closed and we 'd say it looked like he was sleeping
so you can probably piece the rest together
tm we can 't really figure out the reason for this
it might have been that it weighs about a million pounds
tm thank you very much
rm thank you
as an architect i often ask myself what is the origin of the forms that we design
what kind of forms could we design if we wouldn 't work with references anymore
if we had no bias if we had no preconceptions what kind of forms could we design if we could free ourselves from our experience
if we could free ourselves from our education
what would these unseen forms look like
would they surprise us would they intrigue us
would they delight us
if so then how can we go about creating something that is truly new
i propose we look to nature
nature has been called the greatest architect of forms
and i 'm not saying that we should copy nature i 'm not saying we should mimic biology instead i propose that we can borrow nature 's processes
we can abstract them and to create something that is new
nature 's main process of creation morphogenesis is the splitting of one cell into two cells
and these cells can either be identical or they can be distinct from each other through asymmetric cell division
if we abstract this process and simplify it as much as possible then we could start with a single sheet of paper one surface and we could make a fold and divide the surface into two surfaces
we 're free to choose where we make the fold
and by doing so we can differentiate the surfaces
through this very simple process we can create an astounding variety of forms
now we can take this form and use the same process to generate three-dimensional structures but rather than folding things by hand we 'll bring the structure into the computer and code it as an algorithm
and in doing so we can suddenly fold anything
we can fold a million times faster we can fold in hundreds and hundreds of variations
and as we 're seeking to make something three-dimensional we start not with a single surface but with a volume
a simple volume the cube
if we take its surfaces and fold them again and again and again and again then after 16 iterations 16 steps we end up with 400,000 surfaces and a shape that looks for instance like this
and if we change where we make the folds if we change the folding ratio then this cube turns into this one
we can change the folding ratio again to produce this shape or this shape
so we exert control over the form by specifying the position of where we 're making the fold but essentially you 're looking at a folded cube
and we can play with this
we can apply different folding ratios to different parts of the form to create local conditions
we can begin to sculpt the form
and because we 're doing the folding on the computer we are completely free of any physical constraints
so that means that surfaces can intersect themselves they can become impossibly small
we can make folds that we otherwise could not make
surfaces can become porous
they can stretch they can tear
and all of this expounds the scope of forms that we can produce
but in each case i didn 't design the form
i designed the process that generated the form
in general if we make a small change to the folding ratio which is what you 're seeing here then the form changes correspondingly
but that 's only half of the story 99.9 percent of the folding ratios produce not this but this the geometric equivalent of noise
the forms that i showed before were made actually through very long trial and error
a far more effective way to create forms i have found is to use information that is already contained in forms
a very simple form such as this one actually contains a lot of information that may not be visible to the human eye
so for instance we can plot the length of the edges
white surfaces have long edges black ones have short ones
we can plot the planarity of the surfaces their curvature how radial they are all information that may not be instantly visible to you but that we can bring out that we can articulate and that we can use to control the folding
so now i 'm not specifying a single ratio anymore to fold it but instead i 'm establishing a rule i 'm establishing a link between a property of a surface and how that surface is folded
and because i 've designed the process and not the form i can run the process again and again and again to produce a whole family of forms
these forms look elaborate but the process is a very minimal one
there is a simple input it 's always a cube that i start with and it 's a very simple operation it 's making a fold and doing this over and over again
so let 's bring this process to architecture
how and at what scale
i chose to design a column
columns are architectural archetypes
they 've been used throughout history to express ideals about beauty about technology
a challenge to me was how we could express this new algorithmic order in a column
i started using four cylinders
through a lot of experimentation these cylinders eventually evolved into this
and these columns they have information at very many scales
we can begin to zoom into them
the closer one gets the more new features one discovers
some formations are almost at the threshold of human visibility
and unlike traditional architecture it 's a single process that creates both the overall form and the microscopic surface detail
these forms are undrawable
an architect who 's drawing them with a pen and a paper would probably take months or it would take even a year to draw all the sections all of the elevations you can only create something like this through an algorithm
the more interesting question perhaps is are these forms imaginable
usually an architect can somehow envision the end state of what he is designing
in this case the process is deterministic
there 's no randomness involved at all but it 's not entirely predictable
there 's too many surfaces there 's too much detail one can 't see the end state
so this leads to a new role for the architect
one needs a new method to explore all of the possibilities that are out there
for one thing one can design many variants of a form in parallel and one can cultivate them
and to go back to the analogy with nature one can begin to think in terms of populations one can talk about permutations about generations about crossing and breeding to come up with a design
and the architect is really he moves into the position of being an orchestrator of all of these processes
but enough of the theory
at one point i simply wanted to jump inside this image so to say i bought these red and blue 3d glasses got up very close to the screen but still that wasn 't the same as being able to walk around and touch things
so there was only one possibility to bring the column out of the computer
there 's been a lot of talk now about 3d printing
for me or for my purpose at this moment there 's still too much of an unfavorable tradeoff between scale on the one hand and resolution and speed on the other
so instead we decided to take the column and we decided to build it as a layered model made out of very many slices thinly stacked over each other
what you 're looking at here is an x-ray of the column that you just saw viewed from the top
unbeknownst to me at the time because we had only seen the outside the surfaces were continuing to fold themselves to grow on the inside of the column which was quite a surprising discovery
from this shape we calculated a cutting line and then we gave this cutting line to a laser cutter to produce and you 're seeing a segment of it here very many thin slices individually cut on top of each other
and this is a photo now it 's not a rendering and the column that we ended up with after a lot of work ended up looking remarkably like the one that we had designed in the computer
almost all of the details almost all of the surface intricacies were preserved
but it was very labor intensive
there 's a huge disconnect at the moment still between the virtual and the physical
it took me several months to design the column but ultimately it takes the computer about 30 seconds to calculate all of the 16 million faces
the physical model on the other hand is 2,700 layers one millimeter thick it weighs 700 kilos it 's made of sheet that can cover this entire auditorium
and the cutting path that the laser followed goes from here to the airport and back again
but it is increasingly possible
machines are getting faster it 's getting less expensive and there 's some promising technological developments just on the horizon
these are images from the gwangju biennale
and in this case i used abs plastic to produce the columns we used the bigger faster machine and they have a steel core inside so they 're structural they can bear loads for once
each column is effectively a hybrid of two columns
you can see a different column in the mirror if there 's a mirror behind the column that creates a sort of an optical illusion
so where does this leave us
i think this project gives us a glimpse of the unseen objects that await us if we as architects begin to think about designing not the object but a process to generate objects
i 've shown one simple process that was inspired by nature there 's countless other ones
in short we have no constraints
instead we have processes in our hands right now that allow us to create structures at all scales that we couldn 't even have dreamt up
and if i may add at one point we will build them
thank you
fifty years ago in the old soviet union a team of engineers was secretly moving a large object through a desolate countryside
with it they were hoping to capture the minds of people everywhere by being the first to conquer outer space
the rocket was huge
and packed in its nose was a silver ball with two radios inside
on october 4 1957 they launched their rocket
one of the russian scientists wrote at the time we are about to create a new planet that we will call sputnik
in the olden days explorers like vasco da gama and columbus had the good fortune to open up the terrestrial globe
now we have the good fortune to open up space
and it is for those in the future to envy us our joy
you 're watching snippets from sputnik my fifth documentary feature which is just about completed
it tells the story of sputnik and the story of what happened to america as a result
for days after the launch sputnik was a wonderful curiosity
a man-made moon visible by ordinary citizens it inspired awe and pride that humans had finally launched an object into space
but just three days later on a day they called red monday the media and the politicians told us and we believed that sputnik was proof that our enemy had beaten us in science and technology and that they could now attack us with hydrogen bombs using their sputnik rocket as an ibm missile
all hell broke loose
sputnik quickly became one of the three great shocks to hit america historians say the equal of pearl harbor or 9 11
it provoked the missile gap
it exploded an arms race
it began the space race
within a year congress funded huge weapons increases and we went from 1,200 nuclear weapons to 20,000
and the reactions to sputnik went far beyond weapons increases
for example some here will remember this day june 1958 the national civil defense drill where tens of millions of people in 78 cities went underground
or the gallup poll that showed that seven in 10 americans believed that a nuclear war would happen and that at least 50 percent of our population was going to be killed
but sputnik provoked wonderful changes as well
for example some in this room went to school on scholarship because of sputnik
support for engineering math and science education in general boomed
and vint cerf points out that sputnik led directly to arpa and the internet and of course nasa
my feature documentary shows how a free society can be stampeded by those who know how to use media
but it also shows how we can turn what appears at first to be a bad situation into something that was overall very good for america
sputnik will soon be released
in closing i would like to take a moment to thank one of my investors longtime tedster jay walker
and i 'd like to thank you all
thank you chris
ok we 've heard a lot of people speak at this conference about the power of the human mind
and what i 'd like to do today is give you a vivid example of how that power can be unleashed when someone is in a survival situation how the will to survive can bring that out in people
this is an incident which occurred on mount everest it was the worst disaster in the history of everest
and when it occurred i was the only doctor on the mountain
so i 'll take you through that and we 'll see what it 's like when someone really summons the will to survive
ok this is mount everest
it 's 29,035 feet high
i 've been there six times four times i did work with national geographic making tectonic plate measurements twice i went with nasa doing remote sensing devices
it was on my fourth trip to everest that a comet passed over the mountain hyakutake
and the sherpas told us then that was a very bad omen and we should have listened to them
everest is an extreme environment
there 's only one-third as much oxygen at the summit as there is at sea level
near the summit temperatures can be 40 degrees below zero
you can have winds 20 to 40 miles an hour
it 's actually a wind-chill factor which is lower than a summer day on mars
i remember one time being up near the summit i reached into my down jacket for a drink from my water bottle inside my down jacket only to discover that the water was already frozen solid
that gives you an idea of just how severe things are near the summit
ok this is the route up everest
it starts at base camp at 17,500 feet
camp one 2,000 feet higher
camp two another 2,000 feet higher up what 's called the western cwm
campthree is at the base of lhotse which is the fourth highest mountain in the world but it 's dwarfed by everest
and then camp four is the highest camp that 's 3,000 feet short of the summit
this is a view of base camp
this is pitched on a glacier at 17,500 feet
it 's the highest point you can bring your yaks before you have to unload
and this is what they unloaded for me i had four yak loads of medical supplies which are dumped in a tent and here i am trying to arrange things
this was our expedition
it was a national geographic expedition but it was organized by the explorers club
there were three other expeditions on the mountain an american team a new zealand team and an imax team
and after actually two months of preparation we built our camps all the way up the mountain
this is a view looking up the icefall the first 2,000 feet of the climb up from base camp
and here 's a picture in the icefall it 's a waterfall but it 's frozen but it moves very slowly and it actually changes every day
when you 're in it you 're like a rat in a maze you can 't even see over the top
this is near the top of the icefall
you want to climb through at night when the ice is frozen
that way it 's less likely to tumble down on you
these are some climbers reaching the top of the icefall just at sun-up
this is me crossing a crevasse
we cross on aluminum ladders with safety ropes attached
that 's another crevasse
some of these things are 10 stories deep or more and one of my climbing friends says that the reason we actually climb at night is because if we ever saw the bottom of what we 're climbing over we would never do it
okay this is camp one
it 's the first flat spot you can reach after you get up to the top of the icefall
and from there we climb up to camp two which is sort of the foreground
these are climbers moving up the lhotse face that mountain toward camp three
they 're on fixed ropes here
a fall here if you weren 't roped in would be 5,000 feet down
this is a view taken from camp three
you can see the lhotse face is in profile it 's about a 45 degree angle it takes two days to climb it so you put the camp halfway through
if you notice the summit of everest is black
there 's no ice over it
and that 's because everest is so high it 's in the jet stream and winds are constantly scouring the face so no snow gets to accumulate
what looks like a cloud behind the summit ridge is actually snow being blown off the summit
this is on the way up from camp three to camp four moving in up through the clouds
and this is at camp four
once you get to camp four you have maybe 24 hours to decide if you 're going to go for the summit or not
everybody 's on oxygen your supplies are limited and you either have to go up or go down make that decision very quickly
this is a picture of rob hall
he was the leader of the new zealand team
this is a radio he used later to call his wife that i 'll tell you about
these are some climbers waiting to go to the summit
they 're up at camp four and you can see that there 's wind blowing off the summit
this is not good weather to climb in so the climbers are just waiting hoping that the wind 's going to die down
and in fact the wind does die down at night
it becomes very calm there 's no wind at all
this looks like a good chance to go for the summit
so here are some climbers starting out for the summit on what 's called the triangular face
it 's the first part of climb
it 's done in the dark because it 's actually less steep than what comes next and you can gain daylight hours if you do this in the dark
so that 's what happened
the climbers got on the southeast ridge
this is the view looking at the southeast ridge
the summit would be in the foreground
from here it 's about 1,500 feet up at a 30-degree angle to the summit
but what happened that year was the wind suddenly and unexpectedly picked up
a storm blew in that no one was anticipating
you can see here some ferocious winds blowing snow way high off the summit
and there were climbers on that summit ridge
this is a picture of me in that area taken a year before and you can see i 've got an oxygen mask on with a rebreather
i have an oxygen hose connected here
you can see on this climber we have two oxygen tanks in the backpack little titanium tanks very lightweight and we 're not carrying much else
this is all you 've got you 're very exposed on the summit ridge
ok this is a view taken on the summit ridge itself
this is on the way toward the summit on that 1,500-foot bridge
all the climbers here are climbing unroped and the reason is because the drop off is so sheer on either side that if you were roped to somebody you 'd wind up just pulling them off with you
so each person climbs individually
and it 's not a straight path at all it 's very difficult climbing and there 's always the risk of falling on either side
if you fall to your left you 're going to fall 8,000 feet into nepal if you fall to your right you 're going to fall 12,000 feet into tibet
so it 's probably better to fall into tibet because you 'll live longer
but either way you fall for the rest of your life
ok those climbers were up near the summit along that summit ridge that you see up there and i was down here in camp three
my expedition was down in camp three while these guys were up there in the storm
the storm was so fierce that we had to lay fully dressed fully equipped laid out on the tent floor to stop the tent from blowing off the mountain
it was the worst winds i 've ever seen
and the climbers up on the ridge were that much higher 2,000 feet higher and completely exposed to the elements
we were in radio contact with some of them
this is a view taken along the summit ridge
rob hall we heard by radio was up here at this point in the storm with doug hansen
and we heard that rob was ok but doug was too weak to come down
he was exhausted and rob was staying with him
we also got some bad news in the storm that beck weathers another climber had collapsed in the snow and was dead
there were still 18 other climbers that we weren 't aware of their condition
they were lost there was total confusion on the mountain all the stories were confusing most of them were conflicting
we really had no idea what was going on during that storm
we were just hunkered down in our tents at camp three
our two strongest climbers todd burleson and pete athans decided to go up to try to rescue who they could even though there was a ferocious storm going
they tried to radio a message to rob hall who was a superb climber stuck sort of with a weak climber up near the summit
i expected them to say to rob hold on we 're coming
but in fact what they said was leave doug and come down yourself
there 's no chance of saving him and just try to save yourself at this point
and rob got that message but his answer was we 're both listening
todd and pete got up to the summit ridge up in here and it was a scene of complete chaos up there
but they did what they could to stabilize the people
i gave them radio advice from camp three and we sent down the climbers that could make it down under their own power
the ones that couldn 't we just sort of decided to leave up at camp four
so the climbers were coming down along this route
this is taken from camp three where i was
and they all came by me so i could take a look at them and see what i could do for them which is really not much because camp three is a little notch cut in the ice in the middle of a 45-degree angle
you can barely stand outside the tent
it 's really cold it 's 24,000 feet
the only supplies i had at that altitude were two plastic bags with preloaded syringes of painkiller and steroids
so as the climbers came by me i sort of assessed whether or not they were in condition to continue on further down
the ones that weren 't that lucid or were not that well coordinated i would give an injection of steroids to try to give them some period of lucidity and coordination where they could then work their way further down the mountain
it 's so awkward to work up there that sometimes i even gave the injections right through their clothes
it was just too hard to maneuver any other way up there
while i was taking care of them we got more news about rob hall
there was no way we could get up high enough to rescue him
he called in to say that he was alone now
apparently doug had died higher up on the mountain
but rob was now too weak to come down himself and with the fierce winds and up at that altitude he was just beyond rescue and he knew it
at that point he asked to be paged into his wife
he was carrying a radio
his wife was home in new zealand seven months pregnant with their first child and rob asked to be patched into her that was done and rob and his wife had their last conversation
they picked the name for their baby
rob then signed off and that was the last we ever heard of him
i was faced with treating a lot of critically ill patients at 24,000 feet which was an impossibility
so what we did was we got the victims down to 21,000 feet where it was easier for me to treat them
this was my medical kit
it 's a tackle box filled with medical supplies
this is what i carried up the mountain
i had more supplies lower down which i asked to be brought up to meet me at the lower camp
and this was scene at the lower camp
the survivors came in one by one
some of them were hypothermic some of them were frostbitten some were both
what we did was try to warm them up as best we could put oxygen on them and try to revive them which is difficult to do at 21,000 feet when the tent is freezing
this is some severe frostbite on the feet severe frostbite on the nose
this climber was snow blind
as i was taking care of these climbers we got a startling experience
out of nowhere beck weathers who we had already been told was dead stumbled into the tent just like a mummy he walked into the tent
i expected him to be incoherent but in fact he walked into the tent and said to me hi ken where should i sit
and then he said do you accept my health insurance
he really said that
so he was completely lucid but he was very severely frostbitten
you can see his hand is completely white his face his nose is burned
first it turns white and then when it 's completed necrosis it turns black and then it falls off
it 's the last stage just like a scar
so as i was taking care of beck he related what had been going on up there
he said he had gotten lost in the storm collapsed in the snow and just laid there unable to move
some climbers had come by and looked at him and he heard them say he 's dead
but beck wasn 't dead he heard that but he was completely unable to move
he was in some sort of catatonic state where he could be aware of his surroundings but couldn 't even blink to indicate that he was alive
so the climbers passed him by and beck lay there for a day a night and another day in the snow
and then he said to himself i don 't want to die
i have a family to come back to
and the thoughts of his family his kids and his wife generated enough energy enough motivation in him so that he actually got up
after laying in the snow that long a time he got up and found his way back to the camp
and beck told me that story very quietly but i was absolutely stunned by it
i couldn 't imagine anybody laying in the snow that long a time and then getting up
he apparently reversed an irreversible hypothermia
and i can only try to speculate on how he did it
so what if we had beck hooked up to a spect scan something that could actually measure brain function
just very simply the three parts of the brain the frontal lobe where you focus your attention and concentration you have the temporal lobe where you form images and keep memories and the posterior part of your brain which contains the cerebellum which controls motion and the brain stem where you have your basic maintenance functions like heartbeat and respiration
so let 's take a cut through the brain here and imagine that beck was hooked up to a spect scan
this measures dynamic blood flow and therefore energy flow within the brain
so you have the prefrontal cortex here lighting up in red
this is a pretty evenly distributed scan
you have the middle area where the temporal lobe might be in here and the posterior portion where the maintenance functions are in the back
this is a roughly normal scan showing equal distribution of energy
now you go to this one and you see how much more the frontal lobes are lighting up
this might be what beck would be experiencing when he realizes he 's in danger
he 's focusing all his attention on getting himself out of trouble
these parts of the brain are quieting down
he 's not thinking about his family or anybody else at this point and he 's working pretty hard
he 's trying to get his muscles going and get out of this
ok but he 's losing ground here
he 's running out of energy
it 's too cold he can 't keep his metabolic fires going and you see there 's no more red here his brain is quieting down
he 's collapsed in the snow here everything is quiet there 's very little red anywhere
beck is powering down
he 's dying
you go on to the next scan but in beck 's case you can see that the middle part of his brain is beginning to light up again
he 's beginning to think about his family
he 's beginning to have images that are motivating him to get up
he 's developing energy in this area through thought
and this is how he 's going to turn thought back into action
this part of the brain is called the anterior cingulate gyrus
it 's an area in which a lot of neuroscientists believe the seat of will exists
this is where people make decisions where they develop willpower
and you can see there 's an energy flow going from the mid portion of his brain where he 's got images of his family into this area which is powering his will
okay this is getting stronger and stronger to the point where it 's actually going to be a motivating factor
he 's going to develop enough energy in that area after a day a night and a day to actually motivate himself to get up
and you can see here he 's starting to get more energy into the frontal lobe
he 's beginning to focus he can concentrate now
he 's thinking about what he 's got to do to save himself
so this energy has been transmitted up toward the front of his brain and it 's getting quieter down here but he 's using this energy to think about what he has to do to get himself going
and then that energy is sort of spreading throughout his thought areas
he 's not thinking about his family now and he 's getting himself motivated
this is the posterior part where his muscles are going to be moving and he 's going to be pacing himself
his heart and lungs are going to pick up speed
so this is what i can speculate might have been going on had we been able to do a spect scan on beck during this survival epic
so here i am taking care of beck at 21,000 feet and i felt what i was doing was completely trivial compared to what he had done for himself
it just shows you what the power of the mind can do
he was critically ill there were other critically ill patients luckily we were able to get a helicopter in to rescue these guys
a helicopter came in at 21,000 feet and carried out the highest helicopter rescue in history
it was able to land on the ice take away beck and the other survivors one by one and get them off to kathmandu in a clinic before we even got back to base camp
this is a scene at base camp at one of the camps where some of the climbers were lost
and we had a memorial service there a few days later
these are serphas lighting juniper branches
they believe juniper smoke is holy
and the climbers stood around on the high rocks and spoke of the climbers who were lost up near the summit turning to the mountain actually to talk to them directly
there were five climbers lost here
this was scott fischer rob hall andy harris doug hansen and yasuko namba
and one more climber should have died that day but didn 't and that 's beck weathers
he was able to survive because he was able to generate that incredible willpower he was able to use all the power of his mind to save himself
these are tibetan prayer flags
these sherpas believe that if you write prayers on these flags the message will be carried up to the gods and that year beck 's message was answered
thank you
penelope jagessar chaffer i was going to ask if there 's a doctor in the house
no i 'm just joking
it 's interesting because it was six years ago when i was pregnant with my first child that i discovered that the most commonly used preservative in baby care products mimics estrogen when it gets into the human body
now it 's very easy actually to get a chemical compound from products into the human body through the skin
and these preservatives had been found in breast cancer tumors
that was the start of my journey to make this film toxic baby
and it doesn 't take much time to discover some really astonishing statistics with this issue
one is that you and i all have between 30 to 50,000 chemicals in our bodies that our grandparents didn 't have
and many of these chemicals are now linked to the skyrocketing incidents of chronic childhood disease that we 're seeing across industrialized nations
i 'll show you some statistics
so for example in the united kingdom the incidence of childhood leukemia has risen by 20 percent just in a generation
very similar statistic for childhood cancer in the u.s.
in canada we 're now looking at one in 10 canadian children with asthma
that 's a four-fold increase
again similar story around the world
in the united states probably the most astonishing statistic is a 600 percent increase in autism and autistic spectrum disorders and other learning disabilities
again we 're seeing that trend across europe across north america
and in europe there 's certain parts of europe where we 're seeing a four-fold increase in certain genital birth defects
interestingly one of those birth defects has seen a 200 percent increase in the u.s.
so a real skyrocketing of chronic childhood disease that includes other things like obesity and juvenile diabetes premature puberty
so it 's interesting for me when i 'm looking for someone who can really talk to me and talk to an audience about these things that probably one of the most important people in the world who can discuss toxicity in babies is expert in frogs
tyrone hayes it was a surprise to me as well that i would be talking about pesticides that i 'd be talking about public health because in fact i never thought i would do anything useful
frogs
in fact my involvement in the whole pesticide issue was sort of a surprise as well when i was approached by the largest chemical company in the world and they asked me if i would evaluate how atrazine affected amphibians or my frogs
it turns out atrazine is the largest selling product for the largest chemical company in the world
it 's the number one contaminant of groundwater drinking water rain water
in 2003 after my studies it was banned in the european union but in that same year the united states epa re-registered the compound
we were a bit surprised when we found out that when we exposed frogs to very low levels of atrazine 0.1 parts per billion that it produced animals that look like this
these are the dissected gonads of an animal that has two testes two ovaries another large testis more ovaries which is not normal ...
even for amphibians
in some cases another species like the north american leopard frog showed that males exposed to atrazine grew eggs in their testes
and you can see these large yolked-up eggs bursting through the surface of this male 's testes
now my wife tells me and i 'm sure penelope can as well that there 's nothing more painful than childbirth which that i 'll never experience i can 't really argue that but i would guess that a dozen chicken eggs in my testicle would probably be somewhere in the top five
in recent studies that we 've published we 've shown that some of these animals when they 're exposed to atrazine some of the males grow up and completely become females
so these are actually two brothers consummating a relationship
and not only do these genetic males mate with other males they actually have the capacity to lay eggs even though they 're genetic males
what we proposed and what we 've now generated support for is that what atrazine is doing is wreaking havoc causing a hormone imbalance
normally the testes should make testosterone the male hormone
but what atrazine does is it turns on an enzyme the machinery if you will aromatase that converts testosterone into estrogen
and as a result these exposed males lose their testosterone they 're chemically castrated and they 're subsequently feminized because now they 're making the female hormone
now this is what brought me to the human-related issues
because it turns out that the number one cancer in women breast cancer is regulated by estrogen and by this enzyme aromatase
so when you develop a cancerous cell in your breast aromatase converts androgens into estrogens and that estrogen turns on or promotes the growth of that cancer so that it turns into a tumor and spreads
in fact this aromatase is so important in breast cancer that the latest treatment for breast cancer is a chemical called letrozole which blocks aromatase blocks estrogen so that if you developed a mutated cell it doesn 't grow into a tumor
now what 's interesting is of course that we 're still using 80 million pounds of atrazine the number one contaminant in drinking water that does the opposite turns on aromatase increases estrogen and promotes tumors in rats and is associated with tumors breast cancer in humans
what 's interesting is in fact the same company that sold us 80 million pounds of atrazine the breast cancer promoter now sells us the blocker the exact same company
and so i find it interesting that instead of treating this disease by preventing exposure to the chemicals that promote it we simply respond by putting more chemicals into the environment
p so speaking of estrogen one of the other compounds that tyrone talks about in the film is something called bisphenol a bpa which has been in the news recently
it 's a plasticizer
it 's a compound that 's found in polycarbonate plastic which is what baby bottles are made out of
and what 's interesting about bpa is that it 's such a potent estrogen that it was actually once considered for use as a synthetic estrogen in hormone placement therapy
and there have been many many many studies that have shown that bpa leaches from babies bottles into the formula into the milk and therefore into the babies
so we 're dosing our babies our newborns our infants with a synthetic estrogen
now two weeks ago or so the european union passed a law banning the use of bpa in babies bottles and sippy cups
and for those of you who are not parents sippy cups are those little plastic things that your child graduates to after using bottles
but just two weeks before that the u.s. senate refused to even debate the banning of bpa in babies bottles and sippy cups
so it really makes you realize the onus on parents to have to look at this and regulate this and police this in their own lives and how astonishing that is
p with many plastic baby bottles now proven to leak the chemical bisphenol a it really shows how sometimes it is only a parent 's awareness that stands between chemicals and our children
the baby bottle scenario proves that we can prevent unnecessary exposure
however if we parents are unaware we are leaving our children to fend for themselves
th and what penelope says here is even more true
for those of you who don 't know we 're in the middle of the sixth mass extinction
scientists agree now
we are losing species from the earth faster than the dinosaurs disappeared and leading that loss are amphibians
80 percent of all amphibians are threatened and in come decline
and i believe many scientists believe that pesticides are an important part of that decline
in part amphibians are good indicators and more sensitive because they don 't have protection from contaminants in the water no eggshells no membranes and no placenta
in fact our invention by our i mean we mammals one of our big inventions was the placenta
but we also start out as aquatic organisms
but it turns out that this ancient structure that separates us from other animals the placenta cannot evolve or adapt fast enough because of the rate that we 're generating new chemicals that it 's never seen before
the evidence of that is that studies in rats again with atrazine show that the hormone imbalance atrazine generates causes abortion
because maintaining a pregnancy is dependent on hormones
of those rats that don 't abort atrazine causes prostate disease in the pups so the sons are born with an old man 's disease
of those that don 't abort atrazine causes impaired mammary or breast development in the exposed daughters in utero so that their breast don 't develop properly
and as a result when those rats grow up their pups experience retarded growth and development because they can 't make enough milk to nourish their pups
so the pup you see on the bottom is affected by atrazine that its grandmother was exposed to
and given the life of many of these chemicals generations years dozens of years that means that we right now are affecting the health of our grandchildren 's grandchildren by things that we 're putting into the environment today
and this is not just philosophical it 's already known that chemicals like diethylstilbestrol and estrogen pcbs ddt cross the placenta and effectively determine the likelihood of developing breast cancer and obesity and diabetes already when the baby 's in the womb
in addition to that after the baby 's born our other unique invention as mammals is that we nourish our offspring after they 're born
we already know that chemicals like ddt and des and atrazine can also pass over into milk again affecting our babies even after their born
p so when tyrone tells me that the placenta is an ancient organ i 'm thinking how do i demonstrate that
how do you show that
and it 's interesting when you make a film like this because you 're stuck trying to visualize science that there 's no visualization for
and i have to take a little bit of artistic license
old man placenta control
what is it
oh what
puffuffuff what
perflourooctanoic acid
blimey
never heard of it
p and neither had i actually before i started making this film
and so when you realize that chemicals can pass the placenta and go into your unborn child it made me start to think what would my fetus say to me
what would our unborn children say to us when they have an exposure that 's happening everyday day after day
today i had some octyphenols some artificial musks and some bisphenol a .
help me
p it 's a very profound notion to know that we as women are at the vanguard of this
this is our issue because we collect these compounds our entire life and then we end up dumping it and dumping them into our unborn children
we are in effect polluting our children
and this was something that was really brought home to me a year ago when i found out i was pregnant and the first scan revealed that my baby had a birth defect associated with exposure to estrogenic chemicals in the womb and the second scan revealed no heartbeat
so my child 's death my baby 's death really brought home the resonance of what i was trying to make in this film
and it 's sometimes a weird place when the communicator becomes part of the story which is not what you originally intend
and so when tyrone talks about the fetus being trapped in a contaminated environment this is my contaminated environment
this is my toxic baby
and that 's something that 's just profound and sad but astonishing because so many of us don 't actually know this
th one of this things that 's exciting and appropriate for me to be here at tedwomen is that well i think it was summed up best last night at dinner when someone said turn to the man at your table and tell them when the revolution starts we 've got your back the truth is women you 've had our back on this issue for a very long time starting with rachel carson 's silent spring to theo colborn 's our stolen future to sandra steingraber 's books living downstream and having faith
and perhaps it 's the connection to our next generation like my wife and my beautiful daughter here about 13 years ago perhaps it 's that connection that makes women activists in this particular area
but for the men here i want to say it 's not just women and children that are at risk
and the frogs that are exposed to atrazine the testes are full of holes and spaces because the hormone imbalance instead of allowing sperm to be generated such as in the testis here the testicular tubules end up empty and fertility goes down by as much as 50 percent
it 's not just my work in amphibians but similar work has been shown in fish in europe holes in the testes and absence of sperm in reptiles in a group from south america and in rats an absence of sperm in the testicular tubules as well
and of course we don 't do these experiments in humans but just by coincidence my colleague has shown that men who have low sperm count low semen quality have significantly more atrazine in their urine
these are just men who live in an agricultural community
men who actually work in agriculture have much higher levels of atrazine
and the men who actually apply atrazine have even more atrazine in their urine up to levels that are 24,000 times what we know to be active are present in the urine of these men
of course most of them 90 percent are mexican mexican-american
and it 's not just atrazine they 're exposed to
they 're exposed to chemicals like chloropicrin which was originally used as a nerve gas
and many of these workers have life expectancies of only 50
it shouldn 't come to any surprise that the things that happen in wildlife are also a warning to us just like rachel carson and others have warned
as evident in this slide from lake nabugabo in uganda the agricultural runoff from this crop which goes into these buckets is the sole source of drinking cooking and bathing water for this village
now if i told the men in this village that the frogs have pour immune function and eggs developing in their testes the connection between environmental health and public health would be clear
you would not drink water that you knew was having this kind of impact on the wildlife that lived in it
the problem is in my village oakland in most of our villages we don 't see that connection
we turn on the faucet the water comes out we assume it 's safe and we assume that we are masters of our environment rather than being part of it
p so it doesn 't take much to realize that actually this is an environmental issue
and i kept thinking over and over again this question
we know so much about global warming and climate change and yet we have no concept of what i 've been calling internal environmentalism
we know what we 're putting out there we have a sense of those repercussions but we are so ignorant of this sense of what happens when we put things or things are put into our bodies
and it 's my feeling and it 's my urging being here to know that as we women move forward as the communicators of this but also as the ones who carry that burden of carrying the children bearing the children we hold most of the buying power in the household is that it 's going to be us moving forward to carry the work of tyrone and other scientists around the world
and my urging is that when we think about environmental issues that we remember that it 's not just about melting glaciers and ice caps but it 's also about our children as well
thank you
the entire model of capitalism and the economic model that you and i did business in and in fact continue to do business in was built around what probably milton friedman put more succinctly
and adam smith of course the father of modern economics actually said many many years ago the invisible hand which is if you continue to operate in your own self-interest you will do the best good for society
now capitalism has done a lot of good things and i 've talked about a lot of good things that have happened but equally it has not been able to meet up with some of the challenges that we 've seen in society
the model that at least i was brought up in and a lot of us doing business were brought up in was one which talked about what i call the three g 's of growth growth that is consistent quarter on quarter growth that is competitive better than the other person and growth that is profitable so you continue to make more and more shareholder value
and i 'm afraid this is not going to be good enough and we have to move from this 3g model to a model of what i call the fourth g the g of growth that is responsible
and it is this that has to become a very important part of creating value
of not just creating economic value but creating social value
and companies that will thrive are those that will actually embrace the fourth g .
and the model of 4g is quite simple companies cannot afford to be just innocent bystanders in what 's happening around in society
they have to begin to play their role in terms of serving the communities which actually sustain them
and we have to move to a model of an and and model which is how do we make money and do good
how do we make sure that we have a great business but we also have a great environment around us
and that model is all about doing well and doing good
but the question is easier said than done
but how do we actually get that done
and i do believe that the answer to that is going to be leadership
it is going to be to redefine the new business models which understand that the only license to operate is to combine these things
and for that you need businesses that can actually define their role in society in terms of a much larger purpose than the products and brands that they sell
and companies that actually define a true north things that are nonnegotiable whether times are good bad ugly doesn 't matter
there are things that you stand for
values and purpose are going to be the two drivers of software that are going to create the companies of tomorrow
and i 'm going to now shift to talking a little bit about my own experiences
i joined unilever in 1976 as a management trainee in india
and on my first day of work i walked in and my boss tells me do you know why you 're here
i said i 'm here to sell a lot of soap
and he said no you 're here to change lives
you 're here to change lives
you know i thought it was rather facetious
we are a company that sells soap and soup
what are we doing about changing lives
and it 's then i realized that simple acts like selling a bar of soap can save more lives than pharmaceutical companies
i don 't know how many of you know that five million children don 't reach the age of five because of simple infections that can be prevented by an act of washing their hands with soap
we run the largest hand-washing program in the world
we are running a program on hygiene and health that now touches half a billion people
it 's not about selling soap there is a larger purpose out there
and brands indeed can be at the forefront of social change
and the reason for that is when two billion people use your brands that 's the amplifier
small actions can make a big difference
take another example i was walking around in one of our villages in india
now those of you who have done this will realize that this is no walk in the park
and we had this lady who was one of our small distributors beautiful very very modest her home and she was out there dressed nicely her husband in the back her mother-in-law behind and her sister-in-law behind her
the social order was changing because this lady is part of our project shakti that is actually teaching women how to do small business and how to carry the message of nutrition and hygiene
we have 60,000 such women now in india
it 's not about selling soap it 's about making sure that in the process of doing so you can change people 's lives
small actions big difference
our r & amp d folks are not only working to give us some fantastic detergents but they 're working to make sure we use less water
a product that we 've just launched recently one rinse product that allows you to save water every time you wash your clothes
and if we can convert all our users to using this that 's 500 billion liters of water
by the way that 's equivalent to one month of water for a whole huge continent
so just think about it
there are small actions that can make a big difference
and i can go on and on
our food chain our brilliant products and i 'm sorry i 'm giving you a word from the sponsors knorr hellman 's and all those wonderful products
we are committed to making sure that all our agricultural raw materials are sourced from sustainable sources 100-percent sustainable sources
we were the first to say we are going to buy all of our palm oil from sustainable sources
i don 't know how many of you know that palm oil and not buying it from sustainable sources can create deforestation that is responsible for 20 percent of the greenhouse gasses in the world
we were the first to embrace that and it 's all because we market soap and soup
and the point i 'm making here is that companies like yours companies like mine have to define a purpose which embraces responsibility and understands that we have to play our part in the communities in which we operate
we introduced something called the unilever sustainable living plan which said our purpose is to make sustainable living commonplace and we are gong to change the lives of one billion people over 2020
now the question here is where do we go from here
and the answer to that is very simple we 're not going to change the world alone
there are plenty of you and plenty of us who understand this
the question is we need partnerships we need coalitions and importantly we need that leadership that will allow us to take this from here and to be the change that we want to see around us
thank you very much
i was in new york during hurricane sandy and this little white dog called maui was staying with me
half the city was dark because of a power cut and i was living on the dark side
now maui was terrified of the dark so i had to carry him up the stairs actually down the stairs first for his walk and then bring him back up
i was also hauling gallons of bottles of water up to the seventh floor every day
and through all of this i had to hold a torch between my teeth
the stores nearby were out of flashlights and batteries and bread
for a shower i walked 40 blocks to a branch of my gym
but these were not the major preoccupations of my day
it was just as critical for me to be the first person in at a cafe nearby with extension cords and chargers to juice my multiple devices
i started to prospect under the benches of bakeries and the entrances of pastry shops for plug points
i wasn 't the only one
even in the rain people stood between madison and 5th avenue under their umbrellas charging their cell phones from outlets on the street
nature had just reminded us that it was stronger than all our technology and yet here we were obsessed about being wired
i think there 's nothing like a crisis to tell you what 's really important and what 's not and sandy made me realize that our devices and their connectivity matter to us right up there with food and shelter
the self as we once knew it no longer exists and i think that an abstract digital universe has become a part of our identity and i want to talk to you about what i think that means
i 'm a novelist and i 'm interested in the self because the self and fiction have a lot in common
they 're both stories interpretations
you and i can experience things without a story
we might run up the stairs too quickly and we might get breathless
but the larger sense that we have of our lives the slightly more abstract one is indirect
our story of our life is based on direct experience but it 's embellished
a novel needs scene after scene to build and the story of our life needs an arc as well
it needs months and years
discrete moments from our lives are its chapters
but the story is not about these chapters
it 's the whole book
it 's not only about the heartbreak and the happiness the victories and the disappointments but it 's because how because of these and sometimes more importantly in spite of these we find our place in the world and we change it and we change ourselves
our story therefore needs two dimensions of time a long arc of time that is our lifespan and the timeframe of direct experience that is the moment
now the self that experiences directly can only exist in the moment but the one that narrates needs several moments a whole sequence of them and that 's why our full sense of self needs both immersive experience and the flow of time
now the flow of time is embedded in everything in the erosion of a grain of sand in the budding of a little bud into a rose
without it we would have no music
our own emotions and state of mind often encode time regret or nostalgia about the past hope or dread about the future
i think that technology has altered that flow of time
the overall time that we have for our narrative our lifespan has been increasing but the smallest measure the moment has shrunk
it has shrunk because our instruments enable us in part to measure smaller and smaller units of time and this in turn has given us a more granular understanding of the material world and this granular understanding has generated reams of data that our brains can no longer comprehend and for which we need more and more complicated computers
all of this to say that the gap between what we can perceive and what we can measure is only going to widen
science can do things with and in a picosecond but you and i are never going to have the inner experience of a millionth of a millionth of a second
you and i answer only to nature 's rhythm and flow to the sun the moon and the seasons and this is why we need that long arc of time with the past the present and the future to see things for what they are to separate signal from noise and the self from sensations
we need time 's arrow to understand cause and effect not just in the material world but in our own intentions and our motivations
what happens when that arrow goes awry
what happens when time warps
so many of us today have the sensation that time 's arrow is pointing everywhere and nowhere at once
this is because time doesn 't flow in the digital world in the same way that it does in the natural one
we all know that the internet has shrunk space as well as time
far away over there is now here
news from india is a stream on my smartphone app whether i 'm in new york or new delhi
and that 's not all
your last job your dinner reservations from last year your former friends lie on a flat plain with today 's friends because the internet also archives and it warps the past
with no distinction left between the past the present and the future and the here or there we are left with this moment everywhere this moment that i 'll call the digital now
just how can we prioritize in the landscape of the digital now
this digital now is not the present because it 's always a few seconds ahead with twitter streams that are already trending and news from other time zones
this isn 't the now of a shooting pain in your foot or the second that you bite into a pastry or the three hours that you lose yourself in a great book
this now bears very little physical or psychological reference to our own state
its focus instead is to distract us at every turn on the road
every digital landmark is an invitation to leave what you are doing now to go somewhere else and do something else
are you reading an interview by an author
why not buy his book tweet it share it
like it find other books exactly like his
find other people reading those books
travel can be liberating but when it is incessant we become permanent exiles without repose
choice is freedom but not when it 's constantly for its own sake
not just is the digital now far from the present but it 's in direct competition with it and this is because not just am i absent from it but so are you
not just are we absent from it but so is everyone else
and therein lies its greatest convenience and horror
i can order foreign language books in the middle of the night shop for parisian macarons and leave video messages that get picked up later
at all times i can operate at a different rhythm and pace from you while i sustain the illusion that i 'm tapped into you in real time
sandy was a reminder of how such an illusion can shatter
there were those with power and water and those without
there are those who went back to their lives and those who are still displaced after so many months
for some reason technology seems to perpetuate the illusion for those who have it that everyone does and then like an ironic slap in the face it makes it true
for example it 's said that there are more people in india with access to cell phones than toilets
now if this rift which is already so great in many parts of the world between the lack of infrastructure and the spread of technology isn 't somehow bridged there will be ruptures between the digital and the real
for us as individuals who live in the digital now and spend most of our waking moments in it the challenge is to live in two streams of time that are parallel and almost simultaneous
how does one live inside distraction
we might think that those younger than us those who are born into this will adapt more naturally
possibly but i remember my childhood
i remember my grandfather revising the capitals of the world with me
buda and pest were separated by the danube and vienna had a spanish riding school
if i were a child today i could easily learn this information with apps and hyperlinks but it really wouldn 't be the same because much later i went to vienna and i went to the spanish riding school and i could feel my grandfather right beside me
night after night he took me up on the terrace on his shoulders and pointed out jupiter and saturn and the great bear to me
and even here when i look at the great bear i get back that feeling of being a child hanging onto his head and trying to balance myself on his shoulder and i can get back that feeling of being a child again
what i had with my grandfather was wrapped so often in information and knowledge and fact but it was about so much more than information or knowledge or fact
time-warping technology challenges our deepest core because we are able to archive the past and some of it becomes hard to forget even as the current moment is increasingly unmemorable
we want to clutch and we are left instead clutching at a series of static moments
they 're like soap bubbles that disappear when we touch them
by archiving everything we think that we can store it but time is not data
it cannot be stored
you and i know exactly what it means like to be truly present in a moment
it might have happened while we were playing an instrument or looking into the eyes of someone we 've known for a very long time
at such moments our selves are complete
the self that lives in the long narrative arc and the self that experiences the moment become one
the present encapsulates the past and a promise for the future
the present joins a flow of time from before and after
i first experienced these feelings with my grandmother
i wanted to learn to skip and she found an old rope and she tucked up her sari and she jumped over it
i wanted to learn to cook and she kept me in the kitchen cutting cubing and chopping for a whole month
my grandmother taught me that things happen in the time they take that time can 't be fought and because it will pass and it will move we owe the present moment our full attention
attention is time
one of my yoga instructors once said that love is attention and definitely from my grandmother love and attention were one and the same thing
the digital world cannibalizes time and in doing so i want to suggest that what it threatens is the completeness of ourselves
it threatens the flow of love
but we don 't need to let it
we can choose otherwise
we 've seen again and again just how creative technology can be and in our lives and in our actions we can choose those solutions and those innovations and those moments that restore the flow of time instead of fragmenting it
we can slow down and we can tune in to the ebb and flow of time
we can choose to take time back
thank you
when i was nine years old i went off to summer camp for the first time
and my mother packed me a suitcase full of books which to me seemed like a perfectly natural thing to do
because in my family reading was the primary group activity
and this might sound antisocial to you but for us it was really just a different way of being social
you have the animal warmth of your family sitting right next to you but you are also free to go roaming around the adventureland inside your own mind
and i had this idea that camp was going to be just like this but better
i had a vision of 10 girls sitting in a cabin cozily reading books in their matching nightgowns
camp was more like a keg party without any alcohol
and on the very first day our counselor gathered us all together and she taught us a cheer that she said we would be doing every day for the rest of the summer to instill camp spirit
and it went like this r-o-w-d-i-e that 's the way we spell rowdie
rowdie rowdie let 's get rowdie
yeah
so i couldn 't figure out for the life of me why we were supposed to be so rowdy or why we had to spell this word incorrectly
but i recited a cheer i recited a cheer along with everybody else
i did my best
and i just waited for the time that i could go off and read my books
but the first time that i took my book out of my suitcase the coolest girl in the bunk came up to me and she asked me why are you being so mellow mellow of course being the exact opposite of r-o-w-d-i-e
and then the second time i tried it the counselor came up to me with a concerned expression on her face and she repeated the point about camp spirit and said we should all work very hard to be outgoing
and so i put my books away back in their suitcase and i put them under my bed and there they stayed for the rest of the summer
and i felt kind of guilty about this
i felt as if the books needed me somehow and they were calling out to me and i was forsaking them
but i did forsake them and i didn 't open that suitcase again until i was back home with my family at the end of the summer
now i tell you this story about summer camp
i could have told you 50 others just like it all the times that i got the message that somehow my quiet and introverted style of being was not necessarily the right way to go that i should be trying to pass as more of an extrovert
and i always sensed deep down that this was wrong and that introverts were pretty excellent just as they were
but for years i denied this intuition and so i became a wall street lawyer of all things instead of the writer that i had always longed to be partly because i needed to prove to myself that i could be bold and assertive too
and i was always going off to crowded bars when i really would have preferred to just have a nice dinner with friends
and i made these self-negating choices so reflexively that i wasn 't even aware that i was making them
now this is what many introverts do and it 's our loss for sure but it is also our colleagues loss and our communities loss
and at the risk of sounding grandiose it is the world 's loss
because when it comes to creativity and to leadership we need introverts doing what they do best
a third to a half of the population are introverts a third to a half
so that 's one out of every two or three people you know
so even if you 're an extrovert yourself i 'm talking about your coworkers and your spouses and your children and the person sitting next to you right now all of them subject to this bias that is pretty deep and real in our society
we all internalize it from a very early age without even having a language for what we 're doing
now to see the bias clearly you need to understand what introversion is
it 's different from being shy
shyness is about fear of social judgment
introversion is more about how do you respond to stimulation including social stimulation
so extroverts really crave large amounts of stimulation whereas introverts feel at their most alive and their most switched-on and their most capable when they 're in quieter more low-key environments
not all the time these things aren 't absolute but a lot of the time
so the key then to maximizing our talents is for us all to put ourselves in the zone of stimulation that is right for us
but now here 's where the bias comes in
our most important institutions our schools and our workplaces they are designed mostly for extroverts and for extroverts need for lots of stimulation
and also we have this belief system right now that i call the new groupthink which holds that all creativity and all productivity comes from a very oddly gregarious place
so if you picture the typical classroom nowadays when i was going to school we sat in rows
we sat in rows of desks like this and we did most of our work pretty autonomously
but nowadays your typical classroom has pods of desks four or five or six or seven kids all facing each other
and kids are working in countless group assignments
even in subjects like math and creative writing which you think would depend on solo flights of thought kids are now expected to act as committee members
and for the kids who prefer to go off by themselves or just to work alone those kids are seen as outliers often or worse as problem cases
and the vast majority of teachers reports believing that the ideal student is an extrovert as opposed to an introvert even though introverts actually get better grades and are more knowledgeable according to research
okay same thing is true in our workplaces
now most of us work in open plan offices without walls where we are subject to the constant noise and gaze of our coworkers
and when it comes to leadership introverts are routinely passed over for leadership positions even though introverts tend to be very careful much less likely to take outsize risks which is something we might all favor nowadays
and interesting research by adam grant at the wharton school has found that introverted leaders often deliver better outcomes than extroverts do because when they are managing proactive employees they 're much more likely to let those employees run with their ideas whereas an extrovert can quite unwittingly get so excited about things that they 're putting their own stamp on things and other people 's ideas might not as easily then bubble up to the surface
now in fact some of our transformative leaders in history have been introverts
i 'll give you some examples
eleanor roosevelt rosa parks gandhi all these peopled described themselves as quiet and soft-spoken and even shy
and they all took the spotlight even though every bone in their bodies was telling them not to
and this turns out to have a special power all its own because people could feel that these leaders were at the helm not because they enjoyed directing others and not out of the pleasure of being looked at they were there because they had no choice because they were driven to do what they thought was right
now i think at this point it 's important for me to say that i actually love extroverts
i always like to say some of my best friends are extroverts including my beloved husband
and we all fall at different points of course along the introvert extrovert spectrum
even carl jung the psychologist who first popularized these terms said that there 's no such thing as a pure introvert or a pure extrovert
he said that such a man would be in a lunatic asylum if he existed at all
and some people fall smack in the middle of the introvert extrovert spectrum and we call these people ambiverts
and i often think that they have the best of all worlds
but many of us do recognize ourselves as one type or the other
and what i 'm saying is that culturally we need a much better balance
we need more of a yin and yang between these two types
this is especially important when it comes to creativity and to productivity because when psychologists look at the lives of the most creative people what they find are people who are very good at exchanging ideas and advancing ideas but who also have a serious streak of introversion in them
and this is because solitude is a crucial ingredient often to creativity
so darwin he took long walks alone in the woods and emphatically turned down dinner party invitations
theodor geisel better known as dr. seuss he dreamed up many of his amazing creations in a lonely bell tower office that he had in the back of his house in la jolla california
and he was actually afraid to meet the young children who read his books for fear that they were expecting him this kind of jolly santa claus-like figure and would be disappointed with his more reserved persona
steve wozniak invented the first apple computer sitting alone in his cubical in hewlett-packard where he was working at the time
and he says that he never would have become such an expert in the first place had he not been too introverted to leave the house when he was growing up
now of course this does not mean that we should all stop collaborating and case in point is steve wozniak famously coming together with steve jobs to start apple computer but it does mean that solitude matters and that for some people it is the air that they breathe
and in fact we have known for centuries about the transcendent power of solitude
it 's only recently that we 've strangely begun to forget it
if you look at most of the world 's major religions you will find seekers moses jesus buddha muhammad seekers who are going off by themselves alone to the wilderness where they then have profound epiphanies and revelations that they then bring back to the rest of the community
so no wilderness no revelations
this is no surprise though if you look at the insights of contemporary psychology
it turns out that we can 't even be in a group of people without instinctively mirroring mimicking their opinions
even about seemingly personal and visceral things like who you 're attracted to you will start aping the beliefs of the people around you without even realizing that that 's what you 're doing
and groups famously follow the opinions of the most dominant or charismatic person in the room even though there 's zero correlation between being the best talker and having the best ideas i mean zero
so ...
you might be following the person with the best ideas but you might not
and do you really want to leave it up to chance
much better for everybody to go off by themselves generate their own ideas freed from the distortions of group dynamics and then come together as a team to talk them through in a well-managed environment and take it from there
now if all this is true then why are we getting it so wrong
why are we setting up our schools this way and our workplaces
and why are we making these introverts feel so guilty about wanting to just go off by themselves some of the time
one answer lies deep in our cultural history
western societies and in particular the u.s. have always favored the man of action over the man of contemplation and man of contemplation
but in america 's early days we lived in what historians call a culture of character where we still at that point valued people for their inner selves and their moral rectitude
and if you look at the self-help books from this era they all had titles with things like character the grandest thing in the world
and they featured role models like abraham lincoln who was praised for being modest and unassuming
ralph waldo emerson called him a man who does not offend by superiority
but then we hit the 20th century and we entered a new culture that historians call the culture of personality
what happened is we had evolved an agricultural economy to a world of big business
and so suddenly people are moving from small towns to the cities
and instead of working alongside people they 've known all their lives now they are having to prove themselves in a crowd of strangers
so quite understandably qualities like magnetism and charisma suddenly come to seem really important
and sure enough the self-help books change to meet these new needs and they start to have names like how to win friends and influence people
and they feature as their role models really great salesmen
so that 's the world we 're living in today
that 's our cultural inheritance
now none of this is to say that social skills are unimportant and i 'm also not calling for the abolishing of teamwork at all
the same religions who send their sages off to lonely mountain tops also teach us love and trust
and the problems that we are facing today in fields like science and in economics are so vast and so complex that we are going to need armies of people coming together to solve them working together
but i am saying that the more freedom that we give introverts to be themselves the more likely that they are to come up with their own unique solutions to these problems
so now i 'd like to share with you what 's in my suitcase today
guess what
books
i have a suitcase full of books
here 's margaret atwood cat 's eye
here 's a novel by milan kundera
and here 's the guide for the perplexed by maimonides
but these are not exactly my books
i brought these books with me because they were written by my grandfather 's favorite authors
my grandfather was a rabbi and he was a widower who lived alone in a small apartment in brooklyn that was my favorite place in the world when i was growing up partly because it was filled with his very gentle very courtly presence and partly because it was filled with books
i mean literally every table every chair in this apartment had yielded its original function to now serve as a surface for swaying stacks of books
just like the rest of my family my grandfather 's favorite thing to do in the whole world was to read
but he also loved his congregation and you could feel this love in the sermons that he gave every week for the 62 years that he was a rabbi
he would takes the fruits of each week 's reading and he would weave these intricate tapestries of ancient and humanist thought
and people would come from all over to hear him speak
but here 's the thing about my grandfather
underneath this ceremonial role he was really modest and really introverted so much so that when he delivered these sermons he had trouble making eye contact with the very same congregation that he had been speaking to for 62 years
and even away from the podium when you called him to say hello he would often end the conversation prematurely for fear that he was taking up too much of your time
but when he died at the age of 94 the police had to close down the streets of his neighborhood to accommodate the crowd of people who came out to mourn him
and so these days i try to learn from my grandfather 's example in my own way
so i just published a book about introversion and it took me about seven years to write
and for me that seven years was like total bliss because i was reading i was writing i was thinking i was researching
it was my version of my grandfather 's hours of the day alone in his library
but now all of a sudden my job is very different and my job is to be out here talking about it talking about introversion
and that 's a lot harder for me because as honored as i am to be here with all of you right now this is not my natural milieu
so i prepared for moments like these as best i could
i spent the last year practicing public speaking every chance i could get
and i call this my year of speaking dangerously
and that actually helped a lot
but i 'll tell you what helps even more is my sense my belief my hope that when it comes to our attitudes to introversion and to quiet and to solitude we truly are poised on the brink on dramatic change
i mean we are
and so i am going to leave you now with three calls for action for those who share this vision
number one stop the madness for constant group work
just stop it
thank you
and i want to be clear about what i 'm saying because i deeply believe our offices should be encouraging casual chatty cafe-style types of interactions you know the kind where people come together and serendipitously have an exchange of ideas
that is great
it 's great for introverts and it 's great for extroverts
but we need much more privacy and much more freedom and much more autonomy at work
school same thing
we need to be teaching kids to work together for sure but we also need to be teaching them how to work on their own
this is especially important for extroverted children too
they need to work on their own because that is where deep thought comes from in part
okay number two go to the wilderness
be like buddha have your own revelations
i 'm not saying that we all have to now go off and build our own cabins in the woods and never talk to each other again but i am saying that we could all stand to unplug and get inside our own heads a little more often
number three take a good look at what 's inside your own suitcase and why you put it there
so extroverts maybe your suitcases are also full of books
or maybe they 're full of champagne glasses or skydiving equipment
whatever it is i hope you take these things out every chance you get and grace us with your energy and your joy
but introverts you being you you probably have the impulse to guard very carefully what 's inside your own suitcase
and that 's okay
but occasionally just occasionally i hope you will open up your suitcases for other people to see because the world needs you and it needs the things you carry
so i wish you the best of all possible journeys and the courage to speak softly
thank you very much
thank you thank you
being a child and sort of crawling around the house i remember these turkish carpets and there were these scenes these battle scenes these love scenes
i mean look this animal is trying to fight back this spear from this soldier
and my mom took these pictures actually last week of our carpets and i remember this to this day
there was another object this sort of towering piece of furniture with creatures and gargoyles and nudity pretty scary stuff when you 're a little kid
what i remember today from this is that objects tell stories so storytelling has been a really strong influence in my work
and then there was another influence
i was a teenager and at 15 or 16 i guess like all teenagers we want to just do what we love and what we believe in
and so i fused together the two things i loved the most which was skiing and windsurfing
those are pretty good escapes from the drab weather in switzerland
so i created this compilation of the two i took my skis and i took a board and i put a mast foot in there and some foot straps and some metal fins and here i was going really fast on frozen lakes
it was really a death trap i mean it was incredible it worked incredibly well but it was really dangerous
and i realized then i had to go to design school
i mean look at those graphics there
so i went to design school and it was the early 90s when i finished
and i saw something extraordinary happening in silicon valley so i wanted to be there and i saw that the computer was coming into our homes that it had to change in order to be with us in our homes
and so i got myself a job and i was working for a consultancy and we would get in to these meetings and these managers would come in and they would say well what we 're going to do here is really important you know
and they would give the projects code names you know mostly from star wars actually things like c3po yoda luke
so in anticipation i would be this young designer in the back of the room and i would raise my hand and i would ask questions
i mean in retrospect probably stupid questions but things like what 's this caps lock key for
or what 's this num lock key for you know that thing
you know do people really use it
do they need it do they want it in their homes
what i realized then is they didn 't really want to change the legacy stuff they didn 't want to change the insides
they were really looking for us the designers to create the skins to put some pretty stuff outside of the box
and i didn 't want to be a colorist
it wasn 't what i wanted to do
i didn 't want to be a stylist in this way
and then i saw this quote advertising is the price companies pay for being unoriginal
so i had to start on my own so i moved to san francisco and i started a little company fuseproject
and what i wanted to work on is important stuff
and i wanted to really not just work on the skins but i wanted to work on the entire human experience
and so the first projects were sort of humble but they took technology and maybe made it into things that people would use in a new way and maybe finding some new functionality
this is a watch we made for mini cooper the car company right when it launched and it 's the first watch that has a display that switches from horizontal to vertical
and that allows me to check my timer discretely here without bending my elbow
and other projects which were really about transformation about matching the human need
this is a little piece of furniture for an italian manufacturer and it ships completely flat and then it folds into a coffee table and a stool and whatnot
and something a little bit more experimental this is a light fixture for swarovski and what it does is it changes shape
so it goes from a circle to a round to a square to a figure eight
and just by drawing on a little computer tablet the entire light fixture adjusts to what shape you want
and then finally the leaf lamp for herman miller
this is a pretty involved process it took us about four and a half years
but i really was looking for creating a unique experience of light a new experience of light
so we had to design both the light and the light bulb
and that 's a unique opportunity i would say in design
and the new experience i was looking for is giving the choice for the user to go from a warm sort of glowing kind of mood light all the way to a bright work light
so the light bulb actually does that
it allows the person to switch and to mix these two colorations
and it 's done in a very simple way one just touches the base of the light and on one side you can mix the brightness and on the other the coloration of the light
so all of these projects have a humanistic sense to them and i think as designers we need to really think about how we can create a different relationship between our work and the world whether it 's for business or as i 'm going to show on some civic-type projects
because i think everybody agrees that as designers we bring value to business value to the users also but i think it 's the values that we put into these projects that ultimately create the greater value
and the values we bring can be about environmental issues about sustainability about lower power consumption
you know they can be about function and beauty they can be about business strategy
but designers are really the glue that brings these things together
so jawbone is a project that you 're familiar with and it has a humanistic technology
it feels your skin it rests on your skin and it knows when it is you 're talking
and by knowing when it is you 're talking it gets rid of the other noises that it knows about which is the environmental noises
but the other thing that is humanistic about jawbone is that we really decided to take out all the techie stuff and all the nerdy stuff out of it and try to make it as beautiful as we can
i mean think about it the care we take in selecting sunglasses or jewelry or accessories is really important so if it isn 't beautiful it really doesn 't belong on your face
and this is what we 're pursuing here
but how we work on jawbone is really unique
i want to point at something here on the left
this is the board this is one of the things that goes inside that makes this technology work
but this is the design process there 's somebody changing the board putting tracers on the board changing the location of the ics as the designers on the other side are doing the work
so it 's not about slapping skins anymore on a technology
it 's really about designing from the inside out
and then on the other side of the room the designers are making small adjustments sketching drawing by hand putting it in the computer
and it 's what i call being design driven
you know there is some push and pull but design is really helping define the whole experience from the inside out
and then of course design is never done
and this is the other new way that is unique in how we work is because it 's never done you have to do all this other stuff
the packaging and the website and you need to continue to really touch the user in many ways
but how do you retain somebody when it 's never done
and hosain rahman the ceo of aliph jawbone you know really understands that you need a different structure
so in a way the different structure is that we 're partners it 's a partnership we can continue to work and dedicate ourselves to this project and then we also share in the rewards
and here 's another project another partnership-type approach
this is called y water and it 's this guy from los angeles thomas arndt austrian originally who came to us and all he wanted to do was to create a healthy drink or an organic drink for his kids to replace the high-sugar-content sodas that he 's trying to get them away from
so we worked on this bottle and it 's completely symmetrical in every dimension
and this allows the bottle to turn into a game
the bottles connect together and you can create different shapes different forms
thank you
and then while we were doing this the shape of the bottle upside down reminded us of a y and then we thought well these words why and why not are probably the most important words that kids ask
so we called it y water and so this is another place where it all comes together in the same room the three-dimensional design the ideas the branding it all becomes deeply connected
and then the other thing about this project is we bring intellectual property we bring a marketing approach we bring all this stuff but i think at the end of the day what we bring is these values and these values create a soul for the companies we work with
and it 's especially rewarding when your design work becomes a creative endeavor when others can be creative and do more with it
here 's another project which i think really emulates that
this is the one laptop per child the $ 100 laptop
this picture is incredible
in nigeria people carry their most precious belongings on their heads
this girl is going to school with a laptop on her head
i mean to me it just means so much
but when nicholas negroponte and he has spoken about this project a lot he 's the founder of olpc came to us about two and a half years ago there were some clear ideas
he wanted to bring education and he wanted to bring technology and those are pillars of his life but also pillars of the mission of one laptop per child
but the third pillar that he talked about was design
and at the time i wasn 't really working on computers
i didn 't really want to from the previous adventure
but what he said was really significant is that design was going to be why the kids were going to love this product how we were going to make it low cost robust
and plus he said he was going to get rid of the caps lock key and the num lock key too
so i was convinced we designed it to be iconic to look different to look like it 's for a kid but not like a toy
and then the integration of all these great technologies which you 've heard about the wi-fi antennas that allow the kids to connect the screen which you can read in sunlight the keyboard which is made out of rubber and it 's protected from the environment
you know all these great technologies really happened because of the passion and the olpc people and the engineers
they fought the suppliers they fought the manufacturers
i mean they fought like animals for this to remain they way it is
and in a way it is that will that makes projects like this one allows the process from not destroying the original idea
and i think this is something really important
so now you get these pictures you get up in the morning and you see the kids in nigeria and you see them in uruguay with their computers and in mongolia
and we went away from obviously the beige
i mean it 's colorful it 's fun
in fact you can see each logo is a little bit different
it 's because we were able to run during the manufacturing process 20 colors for the x and the o which is the name of the computer and by mixing them on the manufacturing floor you get 20 times 20 you get 400 different options there
so the lessons from seeing the kids using them in the developing world are incredible
but this is my nephew anthony in switzerland and he had the laptop for an afternoon and i had to take it back it was hard
and it was a prototype and a month and a half later i come back to switzerland and there he is playing with his own version
like paper paper and cardboard
so i 'm going to finish with one last project and this is a little bit more of adult play
some of you might have heard about the new york city condom
it 's actually just launched actually launched on valentine 's day february 14 about 10 days ago
so the department of health in new york came to us and they needed a way to distribute 36 million condoms for free to the citizens of new york
so a pretty big endeavor and we worked on the dispensers
these are the dispensers there 's this friendly shape
it 's a little bit like designing a fire hydrant and it has to be easily serviceable you have to know where it is and what it does
and we also designed the condoms themselves
and i was just in new york at the launch and i went to see all these places where they 're installed this is at a puerto rican little mom-and-pop store at a bar in christopher street at a pool hall
i mean they 're being installed in homeless clinics everywhere
of course clubs and discos too
and here 's the public service announcement for this project
get some
so this is really where design is able to create a conversation
i was in these venues and people were you know really into getting them they were excited
it was breaking the ice it was getting over a stigma and i think that 's also what design can do
so i was going to throw some condoms in the room and whatnot but i 'm not sure it 's the etiquette here
yeah all right all right i have only a few
so i have more you can always ask me for some more later
and if anybody asks why you 're carrying a condom you can just say you like the design
so i 'll finish with just one thought if we all work together on creating value but if we really keep in mind the values of the work that we do i think we can change the work that we do
we can change these values can change the companies we work with and eventually together maybe we can change the world
so thank you
thank you so much everyone from ted and chris and amy in particular
i cannot believe i 'm here
i have not slept in weeks
neil and i were sitting there comparing how little we 've slept in anticipation for this i 've never been so nervous and i do this when i 'm nervous i just realized
so i 'm going to talk about sort of what we did at this organization called 826 valencia and then i 'm going to talk about how we all might join in and do similar things
back in about 2000 i was living in brooklyn i was trying to finish my first book i was wandering around dazed every day because i wrote from 12 a.m. to 5 a.m.
so i would walk around in a daze during the day
i had no mental acuity to speak of during the day but i had flexible hours
in the brooklyn neighborhood that i lived in park slope there are a lot of writers it 's like a very high per capita ratio of writers to normal people
meanwhile i had grown up around a lot of teachers
my mom was a teacher my sister became a teacher and after college so many of my friends went into teaching
and so i was always hearing them talk about their lives and how inspiring they were and they were really sort of the most hard-working and constantly inspiring people i knew
but i knew so many of the things they were up against so many of the struggles they were dealing with
and one of them was that so many of my friends that were teaching in city schools were having trouble with their students keeping up at grade level in their reading and writing in particular
now so many of these students had come from households where english isn 't spoken in the home where a lot of them have different special needs learning disabilities and of course they 're working in schools which sometimes and very often are under-funded
and so they would talk to me about this and say you know what we really need is just more people more bodies more one-on-one attention more hours more expertise from people that have skills in english and can work with these students one-on-one
now i would say well why don 't you just work with them one-on-one
and they would say well we have five classes of 30 to 40 students each
this can lead up to 150 180 200 students a day
how can we possibly give each student even one hour a week of one-on-one attention
you 'd have to greatly multiply the workweek and clone the teachers
and so we started talking about this
and at the same time i thought about this massive group of people i knew writers editors journalists graduate students assistant professors you name it
all these people that had sort of flexible daily hours and an interest in the english word i hope to have an interest in the english language but i 'm not speaking it well right now
i 'm trying that clock has got me
but everyone that i knew had an interest in the primacy of the written word in terms of nurturing a democracy nurturing an enlightened life
and so they had you know their time and their interest but at the same time there wasn 't a conduit that i knew of in my community to bring these two communities together
so when i moved back to san francisco we rented this building
and the idea was to put mcsweeney 's mcsweeney 's quarterly that we published twice or three times a year and a few other magazines we were going to move it into an office for the first time
it used to be in my kitchen in brooklyn
we were going to move it into an office and we were going to actually share space with a tutoring center
so we thought we 'll have all these writers and editors and everybody sort of a writing community coming into the office every day anyway why don 't we just open up the front of the building for students to come in there after school get extra help on their written homework so you have basically no border between these two communities
so the idea was that we would be working on whatever we 're working on at 2 30 p.m. the students flow in and you put down what you 're doing or you trade or you work a little bit later or whatever it is
you give those hours in the afternoon to the students in the neighborhood
so we had this place we rented it the landlord was all for it we did this mural that 's a chris ware mural that basically explains the entire history of the printed word in mural form it takes a long time to digest and you have to stand in the middle of the road
so we rented this space
and everything was great except the landlord said well the space is zoned for retail you have to come up with something
you 've gotta sell something
you can 't just have a tutoring center
so we thought ha ha really
and we couldn 't think of anything necessarily to sell but we did all the necessary research
it used to be a weight room so there were rubber floors below acoustic tile ceilings and fluorescent lights
we took all that down and we found beautiful wooden floors whitewashed beams and it had the look while we were renovating this place somebody said you know it really kind of looks like the hull of a ship
and we looked around and somebody else said well you should sell supplies to the working buccaneer
and so this is what we did so it made everybody laugh and we said there 's a point to that
let 's sell pirate supplies this is the pirate supply store
you see this is sort of a sketch i did on a napkin
a great carpenter built all this stuff and you see we made it look sort of pirate supply-like
here you see planks sold by the foot and we have supplies to combat scurvy
we have the peg legs there that are all handmade and fitted to you
up at the top you see the eyepatch display which is the black column there for everyday use for your eyepatch and then you have the pastel and other colors for stepping out at night special occasions bar mitzvahs and whatever
so we opened this place and this is a vat that we fill with treasures that students dig in
this is replacement eyes in case you lose one
these are some signs that we have all over the place practical joking with pirates
while you 're reading the sign we pull a rope behind the counter and eight mop heads drop on your head
that was just my one thing i said we had to have something that drops on people 's heads
it became mop heads and this is the fish theater which is just a saltwater tank with three seats and then right behind it we set up this space which was the tutoring center
so right there is the tutoring center and then behind the curtain were the mcsweeney 's offices where all of us would be working on the magazine and book editing and things like that
the kids would come in or we thought they would come in i should back up
we set the place up we opened up we spent months and months renovating this place
we had tables chairs computers everything
i went to a dot-com auction at a holiday inn in palo alto and i bought 11 g4s with a stroke of a paddle
anyway we bought em we set everything up and then we waited
it was started with about 12 of my friends people that i had known for years that were writers in the neighborhood
and we sat and at 2 30 p.m. we put a sandwich board out on the front sidewalk and it just said free tutoring for your english-related and writing-related needs just come in it 's all free
and we thought oh they 're going to storm the gates they 're gonna love it and they didn 't
and so we waited we sat at the tables we waited and waited
and everybody was becoming very discouraged because it was weeks and weeks that we waited really where nobody came in
and then somebody alerted us to the fact that maybe there was a trust gap because we were operating behind a pirate supply store
we never put it together you know
and so then around that time i persuaded a woman named nineveh caligari a longtime san francisco educator she was teaching in mexico city she had all the experience necessary knew everything about education was connected with all the teachers and community members in the neighborhood i convinced her to move up from mexico city where she was teaching
she took over as executive director
immediately she made the inroads with the teachers and the parents and the students and everything and so suddenly it was actually full every day
and what we were trying to offer every day was one-on-one attention
the goal was to have a one-to-one ratio with every one of these students
you know it 's been proven that 35 to 40 hours a year with one-on-one attention a student can get one grade level higher
and so most of these students english is not spoken in the home
they come there many times their parents you can 't see it but there 's a church pew that i bought in a berkeley auction right there the parents will sometimes watch while their kids are being tutored
so that was the basis of it was one-on-one attention
and we found ourselves full every day with kids
if you 're on valencia street within those few blocks at around 2 p.m. 2 30 p.m. you will get run over often by the kids and their big backpacks or whatever actually running to this space which is very strange because it 's school in a way
but there was something psychological happening there that was just a little bit different
and the other thing was there was no stigma
kids weren 't going into the center-for-kids-that-need-more-help or something like that it was 826 valencia
first of all it was a pirate supply store which is insane
and then secondly there 's a publishing company in the back
and so our interns were actually working at the same tables very often and shoulder-to-shoulder computer-next-to-computer with the students
and so it became a tutoring center publishing center is what we called it and a writing center
they go in and they might be working with a high school student actually working on a novel because we had very gifted kids too
so there 's no stigma
they 're all working next to each other it 's all a creative endeavor
they 're seeing adults they 're modeling their behavior
these adults they 're working in their field
they can lean over ask a question of one of these adults and it all sort of feeds on each other
there 's a lot of cross-pollination the only problem especially for the adults working at mcsweeney 's who hadn 't necessarily bought into all of this when they signed up was that there was just the one bathroom
with like 60 kids a day this is a problem
but you know there 's something about the kids finishing their homework in a given day working one-on-one getting all this attention they go home they 're finished they don 't stall
they don 't do their homework in front of the tv
they 're allowed to go home at 5 30 p.m. enjoy their family enjoy other hobbies get outside play
and that makes a happy family
a bunch of happy families in a neighborhood is a happy community
a bunch of happy communities tied together is a happy city and a happy world
so the key to it all is homework
there you have it you know one-on-one attention
so we started off with about 12 volunteers and then we had about 50 and then a couple hundred
and we now have 1,400 volunteers on our roster
and we make it incredibly easy to volunteer
the key thing is even if you only have a couple of hours a month those two hours shoulder-to-shoulder next to one student concentrated attention shining this beam of light on their work on their thoughts and their self-expression is going to be absolutely transformative because so many of the students have not had that ever before
so we said even if you have two hours one sunday every six months it doesn 't matter that 's going to be enough
so that 's partly why the tutor corps grew so fast
then we said well what are we going to do with the space during the day because it has to be used before 2 30 p.m.
so we started bringing in classes during the day
so every day there 's a field trip where they together create a book you can see it being typed up above
this is one of the classes getting way too excited about writing
you just point a camera at a class and it always looks like this
so this is one of the books that they do
notice the title of the book the book that was never checked out titanic
and the first line of that book is once there was a book named cindy that was about the titanic
so meanwhile there 's an adult in the back typing this up taking it completely seriously which blows their mind
so then we still had more tutors to use
this is a shot of just some of the tutors during one of the events
the teachers that we work with and everything is different to teachers they tell us what to do
we went in there thinking we 're ultimately completely malleable you 're going to tell us
the neighborhood 's going to tell us the parents are going to tell us
the teachers are going to tell us how we 're most useful
so then they said why don 't you come into the schools
because what about the students that wouldn 't come to you necessarily who don 't have really active parents that are bringing them in or aren 't close enough so then we started saying well we 've got 1,400 people on our tutor roster
let 's just put out the word a teacher will say i need 12 tutors for the next five sundays
we 're working on our college essays send them in
so we put that out on the wire 1,400 tutors
whoever can make it signs up they go in about a half an hour before the class
the teacher tells them what to do how to do it what their training is what their project is so far
they work under the teacher 's guide and it 's all in one big room
and that 's actually the brunt of what we do is people going straight from their workplace straight from home straight into the classroom and working directly with the students
so then we 're able to work with thousands and thousands of more students
then another school said well what if we just give you a classroom and you can staff it all day
so this is the everett middle school writers room where we decorated it in buccaneer style
it 's right off the library and there we serve all 529 kids in this middle school
this is their newspaper the straight-up news that has an ongoing column from mayor gavin newsom in both languages english and spanish
so then one day isabel allende wrote to us and said hey why don 't you assign a book with high school students
i want them to write about how to achieve peace in a violent world
and so we went into thurgood marshall high school which is a school that we had worked with on some other things and we gave that assignment to the students
and we said isabel allende is going to read all your essays at the end
she 's going to publish them in a book
she 's going to sponsor the printing of this book in paperback form
it 's going to be available in all the bookstores in the bay area and throughout the world on amazon and you name it
so these kids worked harder than they 've ever worked on anything in their lives because there was that outside audience there was isabel allende on the other end
i think we had about 170 tutors that worked on this book with them and so this worked out incredibly well
we had a big party at the end
this is a book that you can find anywhere so that led to a series of these
you can see amy tan sponsored the next one i might get somewhere
and this became an ongoing thing more and more books
now we 're sort of addicted to the book thing
the kids will work harder than they 've ever worked in their life if they know it 's going to be permanent know it 's going to be on a shelf know that nobody can diminish what they 've thought and said that we 've honored their words honored their thoughts with hundreds of hours of five drafts six drafts all this attention that we give to their thoughts
and once they achieve that level once they 've written at that level they can never go back
it 's absolutely transformative
and so then they 're all sold in the store this is near the planks
we sell all the student books
where else would you put them right
so we sell em and then something weird had been happening with the stores the store actually even though we started out as just a gag the store actually made money
so it was paying the rent
and maybe this is just a san francisco thing i don 't know i don 't want to judge
but people would come in and this was before the pirate movies and everything
it was making a lot of money not a lot of money but it was paying the rent paying a full-time staff member there
there 's the ocean maps you can see on the left
and it became a gateway to the community
people would come in and say what the
what is this i don 't want to swear on the web
is that a rule i don 't know
they would say what is this
and people would come in and learn more about it
and then right beyond there 's usually a little chain there right beyond they would see the kids being tutored
this is a field trip going on and so they would be shopping and they might be more likely to buy some lard or millet for their parrot or you know a hook or hook protector for nighttime all of these things we sell
so the store actually did really well
but it brought in so many people teachers donors volunteers everybody because it was street level it was open to the public
it wasn 't a non-profit buried you know on the 30th floor of some building downtown it was right in the neighborhood that it was serving and it was open all the time to the public
so it became this sort of weird happy accident
so all the people i used to know in brooklyn they said well why don 't we have a place like that here
and a lot of them had been former educators or would-be educators so they combined with a lot of local designers local writers and they just took the idea independently and they did their own thing
they didn 't want to sell pirate supplies
they didn 't think that that was going to work there
so knowing the crime-fighting community in new york they opened the brooklyn superhero supply company
this is sam potts great design that did this
and this was to make it look sort of like one of those keysmith 's shops that has to have every service they 've ever offered you know all over there
so they opened this place inside it 's like a costco for superheroes all the supplies in kind of basic form
these are all handmade
these are all sort of repurposed other products or whatever
all the packaging is done by sam potts
so then you have the villain containment unit where kids put their parents you have the office
this is a little vault you have to put your product in there it goes up an electric lift and then the guy behind the counter tells you that you have to recite the vow of heroism which you do if you want to buy anything and it limits really their sales
personally i think it 's a problem
because they have to do it hand on heart and everything
these are some of the products these are all handmade
this is a secret identity kit
if you want to take on the identity of sharon boone one american female marketing executive from hoboken new jersey it 's a full dossier on everything you would need to know about sharon boone
so this is the capery where you get fitted for your cape and then you walk up these three steel-graded steps and then we turn on three hydraulic fans from every side and then you can see the cape in action
there 's nothing worse than you know getting up there and the cape is bunching up or something like that
so then the secret door this is one of the shelves you don 't see when you walk in but it slowly opens
you can see it there in the middle next to all the grappling hooks
it opens and then this is the tutoring center in the back
so you can see the full effect
but this is i just want to emphasize locally funded locally built
all the designers all of the builders everybody was local all the time was pro-bono
i just came and visited and said yes you guys are doing great or whatever that was it you can see the time in all five boroughs of new york in the back
so this is the space during tutoring hours
it 's very busy same principles one-on-one attention complete devotion to the students work and a boundless optimism and sort of a possibility of creativity and ideas
and this switch is flicked in their heads when they walk through those 18 feet of this bizarre store right
so it 's school but it 's not school
it 's clearly not school even though they 're working shoulder-to-shoulder on tables pencils and papers whatever
this is one of the students khaled hamdan
you can read this quote
addicted to video games and tv couldn 't concentrate at home
came in got this concentrated attention
and he couldn 't escape it
so soon enough he was writing he would finish his homework early got really addicted to finishing his homework early
it 's an addictive thing to sort of be done with it and to have it checked and to know he 's going to achieve the next thing and be prepared for school the next day
so he got hooked on that and then he started doing other things
he 's now been published in five books
he co-wrote a mockumentary about failed superheroes called super-has-beens
he wrote a series on penguin balboa which is a fighting a boxing penguin
and then he read aloud just a few weeks ago to 500 people at symphony space at a benefit for 826 new york so he 's there every day
he 's evangelical about it he brings his cousins in now
there 's four family members that come in every day
so i 'll go through really quickly
this is l.a. the echo park time travel mart whenever you are we 're already then
this is sort of a 7-eleven for time travelers
so you see everything it 's exactly as a 7-eleven would be
leeches mammoth chunks they even have their own slurpee machine out of order come back yesterday
anyway so i 'm going to jump ahead
these are spaces that are only affiliated with us doing this same thing word st. in pittsfield massachusetts ink spot in cincinnati youth speaks san francisco california which inspired us studio st. louis in st. louis austin bat cave in austin fighting words in dublin ireland started by roddy doyle this will be open in april
now i 'm going to the ted wish is that okay
all right i 've got a minute so the ted wish i wish that you you personally and every creative individual and organization you know will find a way to directly engage with a public school in your area and that you 'll then tell the story of how you got involved so that within a year we have a thousand examples a thousand of transformative partnerships
profound leaps forward
and these can be things that maybe you 're already doing
i know that so many people in this room are already doing really interesting things
i know that for a fact so tell us these stories and inspire others on the website
we created a website
i 'm going to switch to we and not i hope we hope that the attendees of this conference will usher in a new era of participation in our public schools
we hope that you will take the lead in partnering your innovative spirit and expertise with that of innovative educators in your community
always let the teachers lead the way
they will tell you how to be useful i hope that you 'll step in and help out
there are a million ways
you can walk up to your local school and consult with the teachers they 'll always tell you how to help
so this is with hot studio in san francisco they did this phenomenal job
this website is already up it 's already got a bunch of stories a lot of ideas it 's called once upon a school which is a great title i think
this site will document every story every project that comes out of this conference and around the world so you go to the website you see a bunch of ideas you can be inspired by and then you add your own projects once you get started
hot studio did a great job in a very tight deadline so visit the site
if you have any questions you can ask this guy who 's our director of national programs he 'll be on the phone
you email him he 'll answer any question you possibly want
and he 'll get you inspired and get you going and guide you through the process so that you can affect change
and it can be fun that 's the point of this talk it needn 't be sterile it needn 't be bureaucratically untenable
you can do and use the skills that you have
the schools need you the teachers need you
students and parents need you they need your actual person your physical personhood and your open minds and open ears and boundless compassion sitting next to them listening and nodding and asking questions for hours at a time
some of these kids just don 't plain know how good they are how smart and how much they have to say
you can tell them you can shine that light on them one human interaction at a time so we hope you 'll join us
thank you so much
today i want to talk about design but not design as we usually think about it
i want to talk about what is happening now in our scientific biotechnological culture where for really the first time in history we have the power to design bodies to design animal bodies to design human bodies
in the history of our planet there have been three great waves of evolution
the first wave of evolution is what we think of as darwinian evolution
so as you all know species lived in particular ecological niches and particular environments and the pressures of those environments selected which changes through random mutation in species were going to be preserved
then human beings stepped out of the darwinian flow of evolutionary history and created the second great wave of evolution which was we changed the environment in which we evolved
we altered our ecological niche by creating civilization
and that has been the second great couple 100,000 years 150,000 years flow of our evolution
by changing our environment we put new pressures on our bodies to evolve
whether it was through settling down in agricultural communities all the way through modern medicine we have changed our own evolution
now we 're entering a third great wave of evolutionary history which has been called many things intentional evolution evolution by design very different than intelligent design whereby we are actually now intentionally designing and altering the physiological forms that inhabit our planet
so i want to take you through a kind of whirlwind tour of that and then at the end talk a little bit about what some of the implications are for us and for our species as well as our cultures because of this change
now we actually have been doing it for a long time
we started selectively breeding animals many many thousands of years ago
and if you think of dogs for example dogs are now intentionally-designed creatures
there isn 't a dog on this earth that 's a natural creature
dogs are the result of selectively breeding traits that we like
but we had to do it the hard way in the old days by choosing offspring that looked a particular way and then breeding them
we don 't have to do it that way anymore
this is a beefalo
a beefalo is a buffalo-cattle hybrid
and they are now making them and someday perhaps pretty soon you will have beefalo patties in your local supermarket
this is a geep a goat-sheep hybrid
the scientists that made this cute little creature ended up slaughtering it and eating it afterwards
i think they said it tasted like chicken
this is a cama
a cama is a camel-llama hybrid created to try to get the hardiness of a camel with some of the personality traits of a llama
and they are now using these in certain cultures
then there 's the liger
this is the largest cat in the world the lion-tiger hybrid
it 's bigger than a tiger
and in the case of the liger there actually have been one or two that have been seen in the wild
but these were created by scientists using both selective breeding and genetic technology
and then finally everybody 's favorite the zorse
none of this is photoshopped these are real creatures
and so one of the things we 've been doing is using genetic enhancement or genetic manipulation of normal selective breeding pushed a little bit through genetics
and if that were all this was about then it would be an interesting thing
but something much much more powerful is happening now
these are normal mammalian cells genetically engineered with a bioluminescent gene taken out of deep-sea jellyfish
we all know that some deep-sea creatures glow
well they 've now taken that gene that bioluminescent gene and put it into mammal cells
these are normal cells
and what you see here is these cells glowing in the dark under certain wavelengths of light
once they could do that with cells they could do it with organisms
so they did it with mouse pups kittens
and by the way the reason the kittens here are orange and these are green is because that 's a bioluminescent gene from coral while this is from jellyfish
they did it with pigs
they did it with puppies
and in fact they did it with monkeys
and if you can do it with monkeys though the great leap in trying to genetically manipulate is actually between monkeys and apes if they can do it in monkeys they can probably figure out how to do it in apes which means they can do it in human beings
in other words it is theoretically possible that before too long we will be biotechnologically capable of creating human beings that glow in the dark
be easier to find us at night
and in fact right now in many states you can go out and you can buy bioluminescent pets
these are zebra fish they 're normally black and silver
these are zebra fish that have been genetically engineered to be yellow green red and they are actually available now in certain states
other states have banned them
nobody knows what to do with these kinds of creatures
there is no area of the government not the epa or the fda that controls genetically-engineered pets
and so some states have decided to allow them some states have decided to ban them
some of you may have read about the fda 's consideration right now of genetically-engineered salmon
the salmon on top is a genetically engineered chinook salmon using a gene from these salmon and from one other fish that we eat to make it grow much faster using a lot less feed
and right now the fda is trying to make a final decision on whether pretty soon you could be eating this fish it 'll be sold in the stores
and before you get too worried about it here in the united states the majority of food you buy in the supermarket already has genetically-modified components to it
so even as we worry about it we have allowed it to go on in this country much different in europe without any regulation and even without any identification on the package
these are all the first cloned animals of their type
so in the lower right here you have dolly the first cloned sheep now happily stuffed in a museum in edinburgh ralph the rat the first cloned rat cc the cat for cloned cat snuppy the first cloned dog snuppy for seoul national university puppy created in south korea by the very same man that some of you may remember had to end up resigning in disgrace because he claimed he had cloned a human embryo which he had not
he actually was the first person to clone a dog which is a very difficult thing to do because dog genomes are very plastic
this is prometea the first cloned horse
it 's a haflinger horse cloned in italy a real gold ring of cloning because there are many horses that win important races who are geldings
in other words the equipment to put them out to stud has been removed
but if you can clone that horse you can have both the advantage of having a gelding run in the race and his identical genetic duplicate can then be put out to stud
these were the first cloned calves the first cloned grey wolves and then finally the first cloned piglets alexis chista carrel janie and dotcom
in addition we 've started to use cloning technology to try to save endangered species
this is the use of animals now to create drugs and other things in their bodies that we want to create
so with antithrombin in that goat that goat has been genetically modified so that the molecules of its milk actually include the molecule of antithrombin that gtc genetics wants to create
and then in addition transgenic pigs knockout pigs from the national institute of animal science in south korea are pigs that they are going to use in fact to try to create all kinds of drugs and other industrial types of chemicals that they want the blood and the milk of these animals to produce for them instead of producing them in an industrial way
these are two creatures that were created in order to save endangered species
the guar is an endangered southeast asian ungulate
a somatic cell a body cell was taken from its body gestated in the ovum of a cow and then that cow gave birth to a guar
same thing happened with the mouflon where it 's an endangered species of sheep
it was gestated in a regular sheep body which actually raises an interesting biological problem
we have two kinds of dna in our bodies
we have our nucleic dna that everybody thinks of as our dna but we also have dna in our mitochondria which are the energy packets of the cell
that dna is passed down through our mothers
so really what you end up having here is not a guar and not a mouflon but a guar with cow mitochondria and therefore cow mitochondrial dna and a mouflon with another species of sheep 's mitochondrial dna
these are really hybrids not pure animals
and it raises the question of how we 're going to define animal species in the age of biotechnology a question that we 're not really sure yet how to solve
this lovely creature is an asian cockroach
and what they 've done here is they 've put electrodes in its ganglia and its brain and then a transmitter on top and it 's on a big computer tracking ball
and now using a joystick they can send this creature around the lab and control whether it goes left or right forwards or backwards
they 've created a kind of insect bot or bugbot
it gets worse than that or perhaps better than that
this actually is one of darpa 's very important darpa is the defense research agency one of their projects
these goliath beetles are wired in their wings
they have a computer chip strapped to their backs and they can fly these creatures around the lab
they can make them go left right they can make them take off
they can 't actually make them land
they put them about one inch above the ground and then they shut everything off and they go pfft
but it 's the closest they can get to a landing
and in fact this technology has gotten so developed that this creature this is a moth this is the moth in its pupa stage and that 's when they put the wires in and they put in the computer technology so that when the moth actually emerges as a moth it is already prewired
the wires are already in its body and they can just hook it up to their technology and now they 've got these bugbots that they can send out for surveillance
they can put little cameras on them and perhaps someday deliver other kinds of ordinance to warzones
it 's not just insects
this is the ratbot or the robo-rat by sanjiv talwar at suny downstate
again it 's got technology it 's got electrodes going into its left and right hemispheres it 's got a camera on top of its head
the scientists can make this creature go left right
they have it running through mazes controlling where it 's going
they 've now created an organic robot
the graduate students in sanjiv talwar 's lab said is this ethical
we 've taken away the autonomy of this animal
i 'll get back to that in a minute
there 's also been work done with monkeys
this is miguel nicolelis of duke
he took owl monkeys wired them up so that a computer watched their brains while they moved especially looking at the movement of their right arm
the computer learned what the monkey brain did to move its arm in various ways
they then hooked it up to a prosthetic arm which you see here in the picture put the arm in another room
pretty soon the computer learned by reading the monkey 's brainwaves to make that arm in the other room do whatever the monkey 's arm did
then he put a video monitor in the monkey 's cage that showed the monkey this prosthetic arm and the monkey got fascinated
the monkey recognized that whatever she did with her arm this prosthetic arm would do
and eventually she was moving it and moving it and eventually stopped moving her right arm and staring at the screen could move the prosthetic arm in the other room only with her brainwaves which means that monkey became the first primate in the history of the world to have three independent functional arms
and it 's not just technology that we 're putting into animals
this is thomas demarse at the university of florida
he took 20,000 and then 60,000 disaggregated rat neurons so these are just individual neurons from rats put them on a chip
they self-aggregated into a network became an integrated chip
and he used that as the it piece of a mechanism which ran a flight simulator
so now we have organic computer chips made out of living self-aggregating neurons
finally mussa-ivaldi of northwestern took a completely intact independent lamprey eel brain
this is a brain from a lamprey eel
it is living fully-intact brain in a nutrient medium with these electrodes going off to the sides attached photosensitive sensors to the brain put it into a cart here 's the cart the brain is sitting there in the middle and using this brain as the sole processor for this cart when you turn on a light and shine it at the cart the cart moves toward the light when you turn it off it moves away
it 's photophilic
so now we have a complete living lamprey eel brain
is it thinking lamprey eel thoughts sitting there in its nutrient medium
i don 't know but in fact it is a fully living brain that we have managed to keep alive to do our bidding
so we are now at the stage where we are creating creatures for our own purposes
this is a mouse created by charles vacanti of the university of massachusetts
he altered this mouse so that it was genetically engineered to have skin that was less immunoreactive to human skin put a polymer scaffolding of an ear under it and created an ear that could then be taken off the mouse and transplanted onto a human being
genetic engineering coupled with polymer physiotechnology coupled with xenotransplantation
this is where we are in this process
finally not that long ago craig venter created the first artificial cell where he took a cell took a dna synthesizer which is a machine created an artificial genome put it in a different cell the genome was not of the cell he put it in and that cell then reproduced as the other cell
in other words that was the first creature in the history of the world that had a computer as its parent it did not have an organic parent
and so asks the economist the first artificial organism and its consequences
so you may have thought that the creation of life was going to happen in something that looked like that
but in fact that 's not what frankenstein 's lab looks like
this is what frankenstein 's lab looks like
this is a dna synthesizer and here at the bottom are just bottles of a t c and g the four chemicals that make up our dna chain
and so we need to ask ourselves some questions
for the first time in the history of this planet we are able to directly design organisms
we can manipulate the plasmas of life with unprecedented power and it confers on us a responsibility
is everything okay
is it okay to manipulate and create whatever creatures we want
do we have free reign to design animals
do we get to go someday to pets r us and say look i want a dog
i 'd like it to have the head of a dachshund the body of a retriever maybe some pink fur and let 's make it glow in the dark
does industry get to create creatures who in their milk in their blood and in their saliva and other bodily fluids create the drugs and industrial molecules we want and then warehouse them as organic manufacturing machines
do we get to create organic robots where we remove the autonomy from these animals and turn them just into our playthings
and then the final step of this once we perfect these technologies in animals and we start using them in human beings what are the ethical guidelines that we will use then
it 's already happening it 's not science fiction
we are not only already using these things in animals some of them we 're already beginning to use on our own bodies
we are now taking control of our own evolution
we are directly designing the future of the species of this planet
it confers upon us an enormous responsibility that is not just the responsibility of the scientists and the ethicists who are thinking about it and writing about it now
it is the responsibility of everybody because it will determine what kind of planet and what kind of bodies we will have in the future
thanks
let me introduce to you rezero
this little fellow was developed by a group of 10 undergraduate students at the autonomous systems laboratory at eth-zurich
our robot belongs to a family of robots called ballbots
instead of wheels a ballbot is balancing and moving on one single ball
the main characteristics of such a system is that there 's one sole contact point to the ground
this means that the robot is inherently unstable
it 's like when i am trying to stand on one foot
you might ask yourself what 's the usefulness of a robot that 's unstable
now we 'll explain that in a second
let me first explain how rezero actually keeps his balance
rezero keeps his balance by constantly measuring his pitch angle with a sensor
he then counteracts and avoids toppling over by turning the motors appropriately
this happens 160 times per second and if anything fails in this process rezero would immediately fall to the ground
now to move and to balance rezero needs to turn the ball
the ball is driven by three special wheels that allow rezero to move into any direction and also move around his own axis at the same time
due to his instability rezero is always in motion now here 's the trick
it 's indeed exactly this instability that allows a robot to move very [ dynamically ]
let 's play a little
you may have wondered what happens if i give the robot a little push
in this mode he 's trying to maintain his position
for the next demo i 'd like you to introduce to my colleagues michael on the computer and thomas who 's helping me onstage
in the next mode rezero is passive and we can move him around
with almost no force i can control his position and his velocity
i can also make him spin
in the next mode we can get rezero to follow a person
he 's now keeping a constant distance to thomas
this works with a laser sensor that 's mounted on top of rezero
with the same method we can also get him to circle a person
we call this the orbiting mode
all right thank you thomas
now what 's the use of this technology
for now it 's an experiment but let me show you some possible future applications
rezero could be used in exhibitions or parks
with a screen it could inform people or show them around in a fun and entertaining way
in a hospital this device could be used to carry around medical equipment
due to the ballbot system it has a very small footprint and it 's also easy to move around
and of course who wouldn 't like to take a ride on one of these
and these are more practical applications
but there 's also a certain beauty within this technology
thank you
thank you
there are two groups of women when it comes to screening mammography women in whom mammography works very well and has saved thousands of lives and women in whom it doesn 't work well at all
do you know which group you 're in
if you don 't you 're not alone
because the breast has become are very political organ
the truth has become lost in all the rhetoric coming from the press politicians radiologists and medical imaging companies
i will do my best this morning to tell you what i think is the truth
but first my disclosures
i am not a breast cancer survivor
i 'm not a radiologist
i don 't have any patents and i 've never received any money from a medical imaging company and i am not seeking your vote
what i am is a doctor of internal medicine who became passionately interested in this topic about 10 years ago when a patient asked me a question
she came to see me after discovering a breast lump
her sister had been diagnosed with breast cancer in her 40s
she and i were both very pregnant at that time and my heart just ached for her imagining how afraid she must be
fortunately her lump proved to be benign
but she asked me a question how confident was i that i would find a tumor early on her mammogram if she developed one
so i studied her mammogram and i reviewed the radiology literature and i was shocked to discover that in her case our chances of finding a tumor early on the mammogram were less than the toss of a coin
you may recall a year ago when a firestorm erupted after the united states preventive services task force reviewed the world 's mammography screening literature and issued a guideline recommending against screening mammograms in women in their 40s
now everybody rushed to criticize the task force even though most of them weren 't in anyway familiar with the mammography studies
it took the senate just 17 days to ban the use of the guidelines in determining insurance coverage
radiologists were outraged by the guidelines
the pre-eminent mammographer in the united states issued the following quote to the washington post
the radiologists were in turn criticized for protecting their own financial self-interest
but in my view the radiologists are heroes
there 's a shortage of radiologists qualified to read mammograms and that 's because mammograms are one of the most complex of all radiology studies to interpret and because radiologists are sued more often over missed breast cancer than any other cause
but that very fact is telling
where there is this much legal smoke there is likely to be some fire
the factor most responsible for that fire is breast density
breast density refers to the relative amount of fat pictured here in yellow versus connective and epithelial tissues pictured in pink
and that proportion is primarily genetically determined
two-thirds of women in their 40s have dense breast tissue which is why mammography doesn 't work as well in them
and although breast density generally declines with age up to a third of women retain dense breast tissue for years after menopause
so how do you know if your breasts are dense
well you need to read the details of your mammography report
radiologists classify breast density into four categories based on the appearance of the tissue on a mammogram
if the breast is less than 25 percent dense that 's called fatty-replaced
the next category is scattered fibroglandular densities followed by heterogeneously dense and extremely dense
and breasts that fall into these two categories are considered dense
the problem with breast density is that it 's truly the wolf in sheep 's clothing
both tumors and dense breast tissue appear white on a mammogram and the x-ray often can 't distinguish between the two
so it 's easy to see this tumor in the upper part of this fatty breast
but imagine how difficult it would be to find that tumor in this dense breast
that 's why mammograms find over 80 percent of tumors in fatty breasts but as few as 40 percent in extremely dense breasts
now it 's bad enough that breast density makes it hard to find a cancer but it turns out that it 's also a powerful predictor of your risk for breast cancer
it 's a stronger risk factor than having a mother or a sister with breast cancer
at the time my patient posed this question to me breast density was an obscure topic in the radiology literature and very few women having mammograms or the physicians ordering them knew about this
but what else could i offer her
mammograms have been around since the 1960 's and it 's changed very little
there have been surprisingly few innovations until digital mammography was approved in 2000
digital mammography is still an x-ray of the breast but the images can be stored and manipulated digitally just like we can with a digital camera
the u.s. has invested four billion dollars converting to digital mammography equipment and what have we gained from that investment
in a study funded by over 25 million taxpayer dollars digital mammography was found to be no better over all than traditional mammography and in fact it was worse in older women
but it was better in one group and that was women under 50 who were pre-menopausal and had dense breasts and in those women digital mammography found twice as many cancers but it still only found 60 percent
so digital mammography has been a giant leap forward for manufacturers of digital mammography equipment but it 's been a very small step forward for womankind
what about ultrasound
ultrasound generates more biopsies that are unnecessary relative to other technologies so it 's not widely used
and mri is exquisitely sensitive for finding tumors but it 's also very expensive
if we think about disruptive technology we see an almost ubiquitous pattern of the technology getting smaller and less expensive
think about ipods compared to stereos
but it 's the exact opposite in health care
the machines get ever bigger and ever more expensive
screening the average young woman with an mri is kind of like driving to the grocery store in a hummer
it 's just way too much equipment
one mri scan costs 10 times what a digital mammogram costs
and sooner or later we 're going to have to accept the fact that health care innovation can 't always come at a much higher price
malcolm gladwell wrote an article in the new yorker on innovation and he made the case that scientific discoveries are rarely the product of one individual 's genius
rather big ideas can be orchestrated if you can simply gather people with different perspectives in a room and get them to talk about things that they don 't ordinarily talk about
it 's like the essence of ted
he quotes one innovator who says the only time a physician and a physicist get together is when the physicist gets sick
this makes no sense because physicians have all kinds of problems that they don 't realize have solutions
and physicists have all kinds of solutions for things that they don 't realize are problems
now take a look at this cartoon that accompanied gladwell 's article and tell me if you see something disturbing about this depiction of innovative thinkers
so if you will allow me a little creative license i will tell you the story of the serendipitous collision of my patient 's problem with a physicist 's solution
shortly after her visit i was introduced to a nuclear physicist at mayo named michael o 'conner who was a specialist in cardiac imaging something i had nothing to do with
and he happened to tell me about a conference he 'd just returned from in israel where they were talking about a new type of gamma detector
now gamma imaging has been around for a long time to image the heart and it had even been tried to image the breast
but the problem was that the gamma detectors were these huge bulky tubes and they were filled with these scintillating crystals and you just couldn 't get them close enough around the breast to find small tumors
but the potential advantage was that gamma rays unlike x-rays are not influenced by breast density
but this technology could not find tumors when they 're small and finding a small tumor is critical for survival
if you can find a tumor when it 's less than a centimeter survival exceeds 90 percent but drops off rapidly as tumor size increases
but michael told me about a new type of gamma detector that he 'd seen and this is it
it 's made not of a bulky tube but of a thin layer of a semiconductor material that serves as the gamma detector
and i started talking to him about this problem with breast density and we realized that we might be able to get this detector close enough around the breast to actually find small tumors
so after putting together a grid of these cubes with tape michael hacked off the x-ray plate of a mammography machine that was about to be thrown out and we attached the new detector and we decided to call this machine molecular breast imaging or mbi
this is an image from our first patient
and you can see using the old gamma technology that it just looked like noise
but using our new detector we could begin to see the outline of a tumor
so here we were a nuclear physicist an internist soon joined by carrie hruska a biomedical engineer and two radiologists and we were trying to take on the entrenched world of mammography with a machine that was held together by duct tape
to say that we faced high doses of skepticism in those early years is just a huge understatement but we were so convinced that we might be able to make this work that we chipped away with incremental modifications to this system
this is our current detector
and you can see that it looks a lot different
the duct tape is gone and we added a second detector on top of the breast which has further improved our tumor detection
so how does this work
the patient receives an injection of a radio tracer that 's taken up by rapidly proliferating tumor cells but not by normal cells and this is the key difference from mammography
mammography relies on differences in the appearance of the tumor from the background tissue and we 've seen that those differences can be obscured in a dense breast
but mbi exploits the different molecular behavior of tumors and therefore it 's impervious to breast density
after the injection the patient 's breast is placed between the detectors
and if you 've ever had a mammogram if you 're old enough to have had a mammogram you know what comes next pain
you may be surprised to know that mammography is the only radiologic study that 's regulated by federal law and the law requires that the equivalent of a 40-pound car battery come down on your breast during this study
but with mbi we use just light pain-free compression
and the detector then transmits the image to the computer
so here 's an example
you can see on the right a mammogram showing a faint tumor the edges of which are blurred by the dense tissue
but the mbi image shows that tumor much more clearly as well as a second tumor which profoundly influence that patient 's surgical options
in this example although the mammogram found one tumor we were able to demonstrate three discrete tumors one is small as three millimeters
our big break came in 2004
after we had demonstrated that we could find small tumors we used these images to submit a grant to the susan g. komen foundation
and we were elated when they took a chance on a team of completely unknown investigators and funded us to study 1,000 women with dense breasts comparing a screening mammogram to an mbi
of the tumors that we found mammography found only 25 percent of those tumors
mbi found 83 percent
here 's an example from that screening study
the digital mammogram was read as normal and shows lots of dense tissue but the mbi shows an area of intense uptake which correlated with a two-centimeter tumor
in this case a one-centimeter tumor
and in this case a 45-year-old medical secretary at mayo who had lost her mother to breast cancer when she was very young wanted to enroll in our study
and her mammogram showed an area of very dense tissue but her mbi showed an area of worrisome uptake which we can also see on a color image
and this corresponded to a tumor the size of a golf ball
but fortunately it was removed before it had spread to her lymph nodes
so now that we knew that this technology could find three times more tumors in a dense breast we had to solve one very important problem
we had to figure out how to lower the radiation dose and we have spent the last three years making modifications to every aspect of the imaging system to allow this
and i 'm very happy to report that we 're now using a dose of radiation that is equivalent to the effective dose from one digital mammogram
and at this low dose we 're continuing this screening study and this image from three weeks ago in a 67-year-old woman shows a normal digital mammogram but an mbi image showing an uptake that proved to be a large cancer
so this is not just young women that it 's benefiting
it 's also older women with dense tissue
and we 're now routinely using one-fifth the radiation dose that 's used in any other type of gamma technology
mbi generates four images per breast
mri generates over a thousand
it takes a radiologist years of specialty training to become expert in differentiating the normal anatomic detail from the worrisome finding
but i suspect even the non-radiologists in the room can find the tumor on the mbi image
but this is why mbi is so potentially disruptive it 's as accurate as mri it 's far less complex to interpret and it 's a fraction of the cost
but you can understand why there may be forces in the breast-imaging world who prefer the status quo
after achieving what we felt were remarkable results our manuscript was rejected by four journals
after the fourth rejection we requested reconsideration of the manuscript because we strongly suspected that one of the reviewers who had rejected it had a financial conflict of interest in a competing technology
our manuscript was then accepted and will be published later this month in the journal radiology
we still need to complete the screening study using the low dose and then our findings will need to be replicated at other institutions and this could take five or more years
if this technology is widely adopted i will not benefit financially in any way and that is very important to me because it allows me to continue to tell you the truth
but i recognize i recognize that the adoption of this technology will depend as much on economic and political forces as it will on the soundness of the science
the mbi unit has now been fda approved but it 's not yet widely available
so until something is available for women with dense breasts there are things that you should know to protect yourself
first know your density
ninety percent of women don 't and 95 percent of women don 't know that it increases your breast cancer risk
the state of connecticut became the first and only state to mandate that women receive notification of their breast density after a mammogram
i was at a conference of 60,000 people in breast-imaging last week in chicago and i was stunned that there was a heated debate as to whether we should be telling women what their breast density is
of course we should
and if you don 't know please ask your doctor or read the details of your mammography report
second if you 're pre-menopausal try to schedule your mammogram in the first two weeks of your menstrual cycle when breast density is relatively lower
third if you notice a persistent change in your breast insist on additional imaging
and fourth and most important the mammography debate will rage on but i do believe that all women 40 and older should have an annual mammogram
mammography isn 't perfect but it 's the only test that 's been proven to reduce mortality from breast cancer
but this mortality banner is the very sword which mammography 's most ardent advocates use to deter innovation
some women who develop breast cancer die from it many years later and most women thankfully survive
so it takes 10 or more years for any screening method to demonstrate a reduction in mortality from breast cancer
mammography 's the only one that 's been around long enough to have a chance of making that claim
it is time for us to accept both the extraordinary successes of mammography and the limitations
we need to individualize screening based on density
for women without dense breasts mammography is the best choice
but for women with dense breasts we shouldn 't abandon screening altogether we need to offer them something better
the babies that we were carrying when my patient first asked me this question are now both in middle school and the answer has been so slow to come
she 's given me her blessing to share this story with you
after undergoing biopsies that further increased her risk for cancer and losing her sister to cancer she made the difficult decision to have a prophylactic mastectomy
we can and must do better not just in time for her granddaughters and my daughters but in time for you
thank you
we grew up interacting with the physical objects around us
there are an enormous number of them that we use every day
unlike most of our computing devices these objects are much more fun to use
when you talk about objects one other thing automatically comes attached to that thing and that is gestures how we manipulate these objects how we use these objects in everyday life
we use gestures not only to interact with these objects but we also use them to interact with each other
a gesture of namaste maybe to respect someone or maybe in india i don 't need to teach a kid that this means four runs in cricket
it comes as a part of our everyday learning
so i am very interested from the beginning that how how our knowledge about everyday objects and gestures and how we use these objects can be leveraged to our interactions with the digital world
rather than using a keyboard and mouse why can i not use my computer in the same way that i interact in the physical world
so i started this exploration around eight years back and it literally started with a mouse on my desk
rather than using it for my computer i actually opened it
most of you might be aware that in those days the mouse used to come with a ball inside and there were two rollers that actually guide the computer where the ball is moving and accordingly where the mouse is moving
so i was interested in these two rollers and i actually wanted more so i borrowed another mouse from a friend never returned to him and i now had four rollers
interestingly what i did with these rollers is basically i took them off of these mouses and then put them in one line
it had some strings and pulleys and some springs
what i got is basically a gesture interface device that actually acts as a motion-sensing device made for two dollars
so here whatever movement i do in my physical world is actually replicated inside the digital world just using this small device that i made around eight years back in 2000
because i was interested in integrating these two worlds i thought of sticky notes
i thought why can i not connect the normal interface of a physical sticky note to the digital world
a message written on a sticky note to my mom on paper can come to an sms or maybe a meeting reminder automatically syncs with my digital calendar a to-do list that automatically syncs with you
but you can also search in the digital world or maybe you can write a query saying what is dr. smith 's address
and this small system actually prints it out so it actually acts like a paper input-output system just made out of paper
in another exploration i thought of making a pen that can draw in three dimensions
so i implemented this pen that can help designers and architects not only think in three dimensions but they can actually draw so that it 's more intuitive to use that way
then i thought why not make a google map but in the physical world
rather than typing a keyword to find something i put my objects on top of it
if i put a boarding pass it will show me where the flight gate is
a coffee cup will show where you can find more coffee or where you can trash the cup
so these were some of the earlier explorations i did because the goal was to connect these two worlds seamlessly
among all these experiments there was one thing in common i was trying to bring a part of the physical world to the digital world
i was taking some part of the objects or any of the intuitiveness of real life and bringing them to the digital world because the goal was to make our computing interfaces more intuitive
but then i realized that we humans are not actually interested in computing
what we are interested in is information
we want to know about things
we want to know about dynamic things going around
so i thought around last year in the beginning of the last year i started thinking why can i not take this approach in the reverse way
maybe how about i take my digital world and paint the physical world with that digital information
because pixels are actually right now confined in these rectangular devices that fit in our pockets
why can i not remove this confine and take that to my everyday objects everyday life so that i don 't need to learn the new language for interacting with those pixels
so in order to realize this dream i actually thought of putting a big-size projector on my head
i think that 's why this is called a head-mounted projector isn 't it
i took it very literally and took my bike helmet put a little cut over there so that the projector actually fits nicely
so now what i can do i can augment the world around me with this digital information
but later i realized that i actually wanted to interact with those digital pixels also
so i put a small camera over there that acts as a digital eye
later we moved to a much better consumer-oriented pendant version of that that many of you now know as the sixthsense device
but the most interesting thing about this particular technology is that you can carry your digital world with you wherever you go
you can start using any surface any wall around you as an interface
the camera is actually tracking all your gestures
whatever you 're doing with your hands it 's understanding that gesture
and actually if you see there are some color markers that in the beginning version we are using with it
you can start painting on any wall
you stop by a wall and start painting on that wall
but we are not only tracking one finger here
we are giving you the freedom of using all of both of your hands so you can actually use both of your hands to zoom into or zoom out of a map just by pinching all present
the camera is actually doing just getting all the images is doing the edge recognition and also the color recognition and so many other small algorithms are going on inside
so technically it 's a little bit complex but it gives you an output which is more intuitive to use in some sense
but i 'm more excited that you can actually take it outside
rather than getting your camera out of your pocket you can just do the gesture of taking a photo and it takes a photo for you
thank you
and later i can find a wall anywhere and start browsing those photos or maybe ok i want to modify this photo a little bit and send it as an email to a friend
so we are looking for an era where computing will actually merge with the physical world
and of course if you don 't have any surface you can start using your palm for simple operations
here i 'm dialing a phone number just using my hand
the camera is actually not only understanding your hand movements but interestingly is also able to understand what objects you are holding in your hand
what we 're doing here is actually for example in this case the book cover is matched with so many thousands or maybe millions of books online and checking out which book it is
once it has that information it finds out more reviews about that or maybe new york times has a sound overview on that so you can actually hear on a physical book a review as sound
this was obama 's visit last week to mit
so i was seeing the live [ video ] of his talk outside on just a newspaper
your newspaper will show you live weather information rather than having it updated like you have to check your computer in order to do that right
when i 'm going back i can just use my boarding pass to check how much my flight has been delayed because at that particular time i 'm not feeling like opening my iphone and checking out a particular icon
and i think this technology will not only change the way yes
it will change the way we interact with people also not only the physical world
the fun part is i 'm going to the boston metro and playing a pong game inside the train on the ground right
and i think the imagination is the only limit of what you can think of when this kind of technology merges with real life
but many of you argue actually that all of our work is not only about physical objects
we actually do lots of accounting and paper editing and all those kinds of things what about that
and many of you are excited about the next generation tablet computers to come out in the market
so rather than waiting for that i actually made my own just using a piece of paper
so what i did here is remove the camera all the webcam cameras have a microphone inside the camera
i removed the microphone from that and then just pinched that like i just made a clip out of the microphone and clipped that to a piece of paper any paper that you found around
so now the sound of the touch is getting me when exactly i 'm touching the paper
but the camera is actually tracking where my fingers are moving
you can of course watch movies
and i am a wilderness explorer in tribe 54 and you can of course play games
here the camera is actually understanding how you 're holding the paper and playing a car-racing game
many of you already must have thought ok you can browse
yeah of course you can browse to any websites or you can do all sorts of computing on a piece of paper wherever you need it
so more interestingly i 'm interested in how we can take that in a more dynamic way
when i come back to my desk i can just pinch that information back to my desktop so i can use my full-size computer
and why only computers we can just play with papers
paper world is interesting to play with
here i 'm taking a part of a document and putting over here a second part from a second place and i 'm actually modifying the information that i have over there
yeah and i say ok this looks nice let me print it out that thing
so i now have a print-out of that thing and now the workflow is more intuitive the way we used to do it maybe 20 years back rather than now switching between these two worlds
so as a last thought i think that integrating information to everyday objects will not only help us to get rid of the digital divide the gap between these two worlds but will also help us in some way to stay human to be more connected to our physical world
and it will actually help us not end up being machines sitting in front of other machines
that 's all thank you
thank you
so pranav first of all you 're a genius
this is incredible really
what are you doing with this is there a company being planned
or is this research forever or what
pranav mistry so there are lots of companies actually sponsor companies of media lab interested in taking this ahead in one or another way
companies like mobile phone operators want to take this in a different way than the ngos in india [ who ] are thinking why can we only have sixth sense
we should have a fifth sense for missing-sense people who cannot speak
this technology can be used for them to speak out in a different way with maybe a speaker system
what are your own plans are you staying at mit or are you going to do something with this
pm i 'm trying to make this more available to people so that anyone can develop their own sixthsense device because the hardware is actually not that hard to manufacture or hard to make your own
we will provide all the open source software for them maybe starting next month
open source wow
are you going to come back to india with some of this at some point
pm yeah yes yes of course
what are your plans mit
india how are you going to split your time going forward
pm there is a lot of energy here lots of learning
all of this work that you have seen is all about my learning in india
and now if you see it 's more about the cost-effectiveness this system costs you $ 300 compared to the $ 20,000 surface tables or anything like that
or maybe even the $ 2 mouse gesture system at that time was costing around $ 5,000
so we actually i showed that at a conference to president abdul kalam at that time and then he said ok we should use this in bhabha atomic research centre for some use of that
so i 'm excited about how i can bring the technology to the masses rather than just keeping that technology in the lab environment
based on the people we 've seen at ted i would say you 're truly one of the two or three best inventors in the world right now
it 's an honor to have you at ted
thank you so much
that 's fantastic
dan holzman please throw out the beanbag chairs here we go
barry friedman there are all kinds of high-tech chairs here today but this is really i think when it reached its peak as far as ergonomics comfort design flexibility ...
dh now obviously this is not something we do on our regular show it 's something we just kind of learned for this so we 're going to try but can we have some inspirational music for the beanbag chairs
bf nice show daniel nice show you are the man
nice show man that was good
dh thank you
bf you know sometimes when people do those they go all the way down
you actually just did that
that 's the kind of extra effort that 's gotten us where we are today ...
dh all right let 's show them something special
bf ... without a macarthur grant
yeah look at this you know all kinds of different ...
ted is about invention let 's be honest right dh yeah it is
bf last night michael moschen showed some juggling props he has invented and working on
right now dan 's going to show something he actually invented
dh a type of juggling i actually invented right after i saw another juggler do it
bf shut up
dh and this is a small excerpt from a longer piece
folks this is shaker cup juggling it 's not a showstopper but it certainly slows it down
bf oh yeah it does
bf oh daniel
dh one more
perfect
perfect
bf ok dh oh all right
i 'm now pushing my luck i 'm skipping right to six cups
in order to do six cups i must have perfect control over three with my right hand
bf also three with his left
dh perfect
and now all six cups should i do it on the first try or should i miss once on purpose
bf first try once on purpose
dh how about if i try first and then decide
bf good idea let 's leave that we 'll leave that door open
dh he 's looking at me
bf that 's all right he does that all right
dh oh it 's time for richard 's help
oh good all right
bf you know over the years every year at the conference it 's kind of become a tradition for us to do something dangerous with richard and we 've always done something with the bullwhips in our act it 's funny for years i did it with daniel holding balloons
and then we thought how stupid
dh excuse me could we work on the design of the microphone
bf i think that 's the next session
dh next session
bf yeah and so we 've actually found a way to incorporate richard in this
he actually assumes more of the danger in this
dh please stand up richard
dh now richard please ...
bf ok sorry
dh jesus christ richard please stand in front of me
richard wurman can i say something
bf sure
rw in all past years i 've rehearsed with them the things that have happened to me i have no idea what 's going to happen and that 's the truth
dh all right please stand here in front ...
god i hate that put your hands out like this please
bf no come stay up with him
dan used to actually hold them but now he 's got you for protection
it 's kind of neat ok
dh wow you 've been working out
bf no shut up
having a little bit of richard time that 's nice that 's good
ok here we go
have him hold your wrist so i can ...
dh please hold my wrist will you bf yeah hold this a minute
there you go
ok
ok hold on
rw hmmm
dh first one
bf all those mid-year phone calls are coming back to me now richard
dh so richard what were we on the list like 1,020
what happened there
bf i think we were just outside
dh i don 't get it
dh sorry bf having some bad flashbacks
rw do you want me to hold you or not dh don 't hold me that hard
bf here we go i 'm taking it
dh one more one more
bf we 've got one more we 're going to do
rw do i get to hold them
bf you don 't want to hold these trust me
dh could you spread your legs a little bit
bf gloria you want to do it it 's very cool
one more try man i don 't want to get too close
could you just push that
dh wow boy
bf that 's cool i always wanted to try that
dh let 's jump this way though
now we risked richard 's life it 's only fair we risk our own lives
so to do that i will juggle these three razor-sharp sickles
and if that wasn 't enough and judging by your response it 's not ...
dh wow bf hoping for a little more build
dh true barry ...
bf i 'm going to run up behind him
dh leap over my shoulder
bf up and over his shoulders
dh grab the blades in mid-air land right there in a pool of blood ...
still juggling
impossible you say
bf incredible you say
dh why bother you say
bf here we go
dh just do it juggler boys you say
bf this guy this guy invented air
dh i think so that 's right
even the pencil
bf he invented the pencil
dh all right we 'll do this trick but please remember it took us over 10 years to perfect
bf ten years to perfect which you 're about to see
dh it 's not that difficult we just don 't like to practice that much
bf no it 's a hassle traveling too much
actually we will take a second to prove this could be fake that the blades are indeed razor-sharp
dh will someone please throw a small farm animal up onto the stage
or a virgin for a sacrifice
bf anything
dh where 's gloria
bf no she 's got ... farm animal
dh do you have a small farm animal
just trying to play the odds all right here we go
bf over the top over the top
dh how you feeling barry you feeling all right
bf yeah it 's all right
dh do you feel everything 's ok the atmosphere the ...
bf yeah a little sketchy
dh everything up here 's ok
bf yeah
dh then here we go
bf this one 's a little ... who 's doing the lights could you point that a little more directly into my eyeballs is that possible i can still see a little
dh and turn up the intensity we 're still pink in the middle
we went too far
bf yeah it 's too far it 's too much of a visual
the design of the body is a whole different thing
dh ready barry bf over the top
dh may we have our jumping music please
may we have it a bit louder
bf they 're a good crew whoa
dh whoa sorry all right
bf we 're going on
dh all right we 'll try again
bf all right oh my gosh oh
dh all right here we go sorry about that
bf i thought i had the hard part ok
dh whenever you 're ready
bf there we go
all right get up come on and dance dh dance come on bf come on and dance
somebody dance come on
wow wow ok stop
weird no one dances we 're two guys doing this
i think that 's uncomfortable for everyone
dh the french judge ...
bf one more quick thing
dh the french judge gives it a 5.2
bf well you know ...
dh there you go ... bf oh yeah another one coming in
dh tell them about our bio and stuff
bf yeah in our bio some of you may have read that we 've won two world juggling championships
and believe it or not you don 't win juggling champions for doing things with bullwhips or shaker cups
we 're going to show you right now an excerpt from a routine that we used to wipe out the other juggling team competition
dh that 's right
bf good
dh i know what you 're thinking other juggling teams must really suck
bf juggling 's got a bad rap
dh but wait barry there 's still one more club lying there by my foot
and look it has a twin
dh there 's still one more by my foot
what do you want me to do with it
bf richard you tell him it 's your last year
dh that 's a pretty good setup richard
bf yeah it 's a good setup that 's a big setup
dh you can 't get any better than that all right what i will do i will use my panther-like reflexes
bf nice
dh i got that to reach down and grab that club in my grip of steel
bf nice
dh i touched it barry that should be enough
bf it 's progress that 's the thing
dh how about that i 'll do it again
oh wait it 's on your side barry
and it 's awfully windy over there
bf it is it 's weird you wouldn 't think it would affect half the stage but it is it 's weird
watch this what i 'm going to do is slide the seventh one onto my foot
dh wow what a great trick barry
oh look how it lies there
oh barry is there nothing you can 't do
you are my hero you 're my jim shea jr
too much olympics
bf from my foot i 'll attempt to kick the seventh club here we go
dh where barry where tell us barry
[ unclear ] eagerly awaits your next syllable what will it be
what gem of knowledge
what pearl of wisdom
do you want to buy a vowel barry
is that your final answer
bf all right you have to turn off the tv from time to time
dh i do i do
bf from my foot the kick up in the seven
dh we will juggle seven
bf from six to seven dh that 's a world 's record bf really dh for us
bf yes
dh whenever you 're ready there big guy
put your tongue away barry
bf oh oh whoa
dh please please stay seated stay seated thank you
because now to make this twice as difficult we 'll juggle the seven clubs back ...
bf seven-club juggling
dh ... to back
bf thank you that 's it
bf thank you guys
dh thank you very much
so let me just start with my story
so i tore my knee joint meniscus cartilage playing soccer in college
then i went on to tear my acl the ligament in my knee and then developed an arthritic knee
and i 'm sure that many of you in this audience have that same story and by the way i married a woman who has exactly the same story
so this motivated me to become an orthopedic surgeon and to see if i couldn 't focus on solutions for those problems that would keep me playing sports and not limit me
so with that let me just show you a quick video to get you in the mood of what we 're trying to explain
we are all aware of the risk of cancer but there 's another disease that 's destined to affect even more of us arthritis
cancer may kill you but when you look at the numbers arthritis ruins more lives
assuming you live a long life there 's a 50 percent chance you 'll develop arthritis
and it 's not just aging that causes arthritis
common injuries can lead to decades of pain until our joints quite literally grind to a halt
desperate for a solution we 've turned to engineering to design artificial components to replace our worn-out body parts but in the midst of the modern buzz around the promises of a bionic body shouldn 't we stop and ask if there 's a better more natural way
let 's consider an alternative path
what if all the replacements our bodies need already exist in nature or within our own stem cells
this is the field of biologic replacements where we replace worn-out parts with new natural ones
kevin stone and so the mission is how do i treat these things biologically
and let 's talk about both what i did for my wife and what i 've done for hundreds of other patients
first thing for my wife and the most common thing i hear from my patients particularly in the 40- to 80-year-old age group 70-year-old age group is they come in and say hey doc isn 't there just a shock absorber you can put in my knee
i 'm not ready for joint replacement
and so for her i put in a human meniscus allograft donor right into that [ knee ] joint space
and [ the allograft ] replaces [ the missing meniscus ]
and then for that unstable ligament we put in a human donor ligament to stabilize the knee
and then for the damaged arthritis on the surface we did a stem cell paste graft which we designed in 1991 to regrow that articular cartilage surface and give it back a smooth surface there
so here 's my wife 's bad knee on the left and her just hiking now four months later in aspen and doing well
and it works not just for my wife but certainly for other patients
the girl on the video jen hudak just won the superpipe in aspen just nine months after having destroyed her knee as you see in the other image and having a paste graft to that knee
and so we can regrow these surfaces biologically
so with all this success why isn 't that good enough you might ask
well the reason is because there 's not enough donor cycles
there 's not enough young healthy people falling off their motorcycle and donating that tissue to us
and the tissue 's very expensive
and so that 's not going to be a solution that 's going to get us global with biologic tissue
but the solution is animal tissue because it 's plentiful it 's cheap you can get it from young healthy tissues but the barrier is immunology
and the specific barrier is a specific epitope called the galactosyl or gal epitope
so if we 're going to transplant animal tissues to people we have to figure out a way to get rid of that epitope
so my story in working with animal tissues starts in 1984
and i started first with cow achilles tendon where we would take the cow achilles tendon which is type-i collagen strip it of its antigens by degrading it with an acid and detergent wash and forming it into a regeneration template
we would then take that regeneration template and insert it into the missing meniscus cartilage to regrow that in a patient 's knee
we 've now done that procedure and it 's been done worldwide in over 4,000 cases so it 's an fda-approved and worldwide-accepted way to regrow the meniscus
and that 's great when i can degrade the tissue
but what happens for your ligament when i need an intact ligament
i can 't grind it up in a blender
so in that case i have to design and we designed with uri galili and tom turek an enzyme wash to wash away or strip those galactosyl epitopes with a specific enzyme
and we call that a gal stripping technique
what we do is humanize the tissue
it 's by gal stripping that tissue we humanize it and then we can put it back into a patient 's knee
and we 've done that now we 've taken pig ligament young healthy big tissue put it into 10 patients in an fda-approved trial and then one of our patients went on to have three canadian masters downhill championships on his pig-lig as he calls it so we know it can work
and there 's a wide clinical trial of this tissue now pending
so what about the next step
what about getting to a total biologic knee replacement not just the parts
how are we going to revolutionize artificial joint replacement
well here 's how we 're going to do it
so what we 're going to do is take an articular cartilage from a young healthy pig strip it of its antigens load it with your stem cells then put it back on to that arthritic surface in your knee tack it on there have you heal that surface and then create a new biologic surface for your knee
so that 's our biologic approach right now
we 're going to rebuild your knee with the parts
we 're going to resurface it with a completely new surface
but we have other advantages from the animal kingdom
there 's a benefit of 400 million years of ambulation
we can harness those benefits
we can use thicker younger better tissues than you might have injured in your knee or that you might have when you 're 40 50 or 60
we can do it as an outpatient procedure
we can strip that tissue very economically and so this is how we can get biologic knee replacement to go global
and so welcome to super biologics
it 's not hardware
it 's not software
it 's bioware
it 's version 2.0 of you
and so with that coming to a coming to an operating theater near you soon i believe
thank you very much
okay i 'm going to show you again something about our diets
and i would like to know what the audience is and so who of you ever ate insects
that 's quite a lot
but still you 're not representing the overall population of the earth
because there 's 80 percent out there that really eats insects
but this is quite good
why not eat insects well first what are insects
insects are animals that walk around on six legs
and here you see just a selection
there 's six million species of insects on this planet six million species
there 's a few hundreds of mammals six million species of insects
in fact if we count all the individual organisms we would come at much larger numbers
in fact of all animals on earth of all animal species 80 percent walks on six legs
but if we would count all the individuals and we take an average weight of them it would amount to something like 200 to 2,000 kilograms for each of you and me on earth
that means that in terms of biomass insects are more abundant than we are and we 're not on a planet of men but we 're on a planet of insects
insects are not only there in nature but they also are involved in our economy usually without us knowing
there was an estimation a conservative estimation a couple of years ago that the u.s. economy benefited by 57 billion dollars per year
it 's a number very large a contribution to the economy of the united states for free
and so i looked up what the economy was paying for the war in iraq in the same year
it was 80 billion u.s. dollars
well we know that that was not a cheap war
so insects just for free contribute to the economy of the united states with about the same order of magnitude just for free without everyone knowing
and not only in the states but in any country in any economy
what do they do
they remove dung they pollinate our crops
a third of all the fruits that we eat are all a result of insects taking care of the reproduction of plants
they control pests and they 're food for animals
they 're at the start of food chains
small animals eat insects
even larger animals eat insects
but the small animals that eat insects are being eaten by larger animals still larger animals
and at the end of the food chain we are eating them as well
there 's quite a lot of people that are eating insects
and here you see me in a small provincial town in china lijiang about two million inhabitants
if you go out for dinner like in a fish restaurant where you can select which fish you want to eat you can select which insects you would like to eat
and they prepare it in a wonderful way
and here you see me enjoying a meal with caterpillars locusts bee pupae delicacies
and you can eat something new everyday
there 's more than 1,000 species of insects that are being eaten all around the globe
that 's quite a bit more than just a few mammals that we 're eating like a cow or a pig or a sheep
more than 1,000 species an enormous variety
and now you may think okay in this provincial town in china they 're doing that but not us
well we 've seen already that quite some of you already ate insects maybe occasionally but i can tell you that every one of you is eating insects without any exception
you 're eating at least 500 grams per year
what are you eating
tomato soup peanut butter chocolate noodles any processed food that you 're eating contains insects because insects are here all around us and when they 're out there in nature they 're also in our crops
some fruits get some insect damage
those are the fruits if they 're tomato that go to the tomato soup
if they don 't have any damage they go to the grocery
and that 's your view of a tomato
but there 's tomatoes that end up in a soup and as long as they meet the requirements of the food agency there can be all kinds of things in there no problem
in fact why would we put these balls in the soup there 's meat in there anyway
in fact all our processed foods contain more proteins than we would be aware of
so anything is a good protein source already
now you may say okay so we 're eating 500 grams just by accident
we 're even doing this on purpose
in a lot of food items that we have i have only two items here on the slide pink cookies or surimi sticks or if you like campari a lot of our food products that are of a red color are dyed with a natural dye
the surimi sticks [ of ] crabmeat or is being sold as crab meat is white fish that 's being dyed with cochineal
cochineal is a product of an insect that lives off these cacti
it 's being produced in large amounts 150 to 180 metric tons per year in the canary islands in peru and it 's big business
one gram of cochineal costs about 30 euros
one gram of gold is 30 euros
so it 's a very precious thing that we 're using to dye our foods
now the situation in the world is going to change for you and me for everyone on this earth
the human population is growing very rapidly and is growing exponentially
where at the moment we have something between six and seven billion people it will grow to about nine billion in 2050
that means that we have a lot more mouths to feed and this is something that worries more and more people
there was an fao conference last october that was completely devoted to this
how are we going to feed this world
and if you look at the figures up there it says that we have a third more mouths to feed but we need an agricultural production increase of 70 percent
and that 's especially because this world population is increasing and it 's increasing not only in numbers but we 're also getting wealthier and anyone that gets wealthier starts to eat more and also starts to eat more meat
and meat in fact is something that costs a lot of our agricultural production
our diet consists [ in ] some part of animal proteins and at the moment most of us here get it from livestock from fish from game
and we eat quite a lot of it
in the developed world it 's on average 80 kilograms per person per year which goes up to 120 in the united states and a bit lower in some other countries but on average 80 kilograms per person per year
in the developing world it 's much lower
it 's 25 kilograms per person per year
but it 's increasing enormously
in china in the last 20 years it increased from 20 to 50 and it 's still increasing
so if a third of the world population is going to increase its meat consumption from 25 to 80 on average and a third of the world population is living in china and in india we 're having an enormous demand on meat
and of course we are not there to say that 's only for us it 's not for them
they have the same share that we have
now to start with i should say that we are eating way too much meat in the western world
we could do with much much less and i know i 've been a vegetarian for a long time and you can easily do without anything
you 'll get proteins in any kind of food anyway
but then there 's a lot of problems that come with meat production and we 're being faced with that more and more often
the first problem that we 're facing is human health
pigs are quite like us
they 're even models in medicine and we can even transplant organs from a pig to a human
that means that pigs also share diseases with us
and a pig disease a pig virus and a human virus can both proliferate and because of their kind of reproduction they can combine and produce a new virus
this has happened in the netherlands in the 1990s during the classical swine fever outbreak
you get a new disease that can be deadly
we eat insects they 're so distantly related from us that this doesn 't happen
so that 's one point for insects
and there 's the conversion factor
you take 10 kilograms of feed you can get one kilogram of beef but you can get nine kilograms of locust meat
so if you would be an entrepreneur what would you do
with 10 kilograms of input you can get either one or nine kg. of output
so far we 're taking the one or up to five kilograms of output
we 're not taking the bonus yet
we 're not taking the nine kilograms of output yet
so that 's two points for insects
and there 's the environment
if we take 10 kilograms of food and it results in one kilogram of beef the other nine kilograms are waste and a lot of that is manure
if you produce insects you have less manure per kilogram of meat that you produce
so less waste
furthermore per kilogram of manure you have much much less ammonia and fewer greenhouse gases when you have insect manure than when you have cow manure
so you have less waste and the waste that you have is not as environmental malign as it is with cow dung
so that 's three points for insects
now there 's a big if of course and it is if insects produce meat that is of good quality
well there have been all kinds of analyses and in terms of protein or fat or vitamins it 's very good
in fact it 's comparable to anything we eat as meat at the moment
and even in terms of calories it is very good
one kilogram of grasshoppers has the same amount of calories as 10 hot dogs or six big macs
so that 's four points for insects
i can go on and i could make many more points for insects but time doesn 't allow this
so the question is why not eat insects
i gave you at least four arguments in favor
we 'll have to
even if you don 't like it you 'll have to get used to this because at the moment 70 percent of all our agricultural land is being used to produce livestock
that 's not only the land where the livestock is walking and feeding but it 's also other areas where the feed is being produced and being transported
we can increase it a bit at the expense of rainforests but there 's a limitation very soon
and if you remember that we need to increase agricultural production by 70 percent we 're not going to make it that way
we could much better change from meat from beef to insects
and then 80 percent of the world already eats insects so we are just a minority in a country like the u.k. the usa the netherlands anywhere
on the left-hand side you see a market in laos where they have abundantly present all kinds of insects that you choose for dinner for the night
on the right-hand side you see a grasshopper
so people there are eating them not because they 're hungry but because they think it 's a delicacy
it 's just very good food
you can vary enormously
it has many benefits
in fact we have delicacy that 's very much like this grasshopper shrimps a delicacy being sold at a high price
who wouldn 't like to eat a shrimp
there are a few people who don 't like shrimp but shrimp or crabs or crayfish are very closely related
they are delicacies
in fact a locust is a shrimp of the land and it would make very good into our diet
so why are we not eating insects yet
well that 's just a matter of mindset
we 're not used to it and we see insects as these organisms that are very different from us
that 's why we 're changing the perception of insects
and i 'm working very hard with my colleague arnold van huis in telling people what insects are what magnificent things they are what magnificent jobs they do in nature
and in fact without insects we would not be here in this room because if the insects die out we will soon die out as well
if we die out the insects will continue very happily
so we have to get used to the idea of eating insects
and some might think well they 're not yet available
well they are
there are entrepreneurs in the netherlands that produce them and one of them is here in the audience marian peeters who 's in the picture
i predict that later this year you 'll get them in the supermarkets not visible but as animal protein in the food
and maybe by 2020 you 'll buy them just knowing that this is an insect that you 're going to eat
and they 're being made in the most wonderful ways
a dutch chocolate maker
so there 's even a lot of design to it
well in the netherlands we have an innovative minister of agriculture and she puts the insects on the menu in her restaurant in her ministry
and when she got all the ministers of agriculture of the e.u.
over to the hague recently she went to a high-class restaurant and they ate insects all together
it 's not something that is a hobby of mine
it 's really taken off the ground
so why not eat insects
you should try it yourself
a couple of years ago we had 1,750 people all together in a square in wageningen town and they ate insects at the same moment and this was still big big news
i think soon it will not be big news anymore when we all eat insects because it 's just a normal way of doing
so you can try it yourself today and i would say enjoy
and i 'm going to show to bruno some first tries and he can have the first bite
look at them first look at them first
marcel dicke it 's all protein
that 's exactly the same [ one ] you saw in the video actually
and it looks delicious
they just make it [ with ] nuts or something
md thank you
i want to talk about what we learn from conservatives
and i 'm at a stage in life where i 'm yearning for my old days so i want to confess to you that when i was a kid indeed i was a conservative
i was a young republican a teenage republican a leader in the teenage republicans
indeed i was the youngest member of any delegation in the 1980 convention that elected ronald reagan to be the republican nominee for president
now i know what you 're thinking
you 're thinking that 's not what the internets say
you 're thinking wikipedia doesn 't say this fact
and indeed this is just one of the examples of the junk that flows across the tubes in these internets here
wikipedia reports that this guy this former congressman from erie pennsylvania was at the age of 20 one of the youngest people at the republican national convention but it 's just not true
indeed it drives me so nuts let me just change this little fact here
all right okay so ... perfect
perfect
okay speaker lawrence lessig right
okay
finally truth will be brought here
okay see it 's done it 's almost done here we go
... youngest republican okay we 're finished
that 's it please save this
great here we go
and ... wikipedia is fixed finally
okay but no this is really besides the point
but the thing i want you to think about when we think about conservatives not so much this issue of the 1980 convention the thing to think about is this they go to church
now you know i mean a lot of people go to church
i 'm not talking about that only conservatives go to church
and i 'm not talking about the god thing
i don 't want to get into that you know that 's not my point
they go to church by which i mean they do lots of things for free for each other
they hold potluck dinners
indeed they sell books about potluck dinners
they serve food to poor people
they share they give they give away for free
and it 's the very same people leading wall street firms who on sundays show up and share
and not only food right
these very same people are strong believers in lots of contexts in the limits on the markets
they are in many important places against markets
indeed they like all of us celebrate this kind of relationship
but they 're very keen that we don 't let money drop into that relationship else it turns into something like this
they want to regulate us those conservatives to stop us from allowing the market to spread in those places
because they understand there are places for the market and places where the market should not exist where we should be free to enjoy the fellowship of others
they recognize both of these things have to live together
and the second great thing about conservatives they get ecology
right it was the first great republican president of the 20th century who taught us about environmental thinking teddy roosevelt
they first taught us about ecology in the context of natural resources
and then they began to teach us in the context of innovation economics
they understand in that context free they understand free is an important essential part of the cultural ecology as well
that 's the thing i want you to think about them
now i know you don 't believe me really here
so here 's exhibit number one
i want to share with you my latest hero julian sanchez a libertarian who works at the for many people evil cato institute
okay so julian made this video
he 's a terrible producer of videos but it 's great content so i 'm going to give you a little bit of it
so here he is beginning
julian sanchez i 'm going to make an observation about the way remix culture seems to be evolving ...
larry lessig so what he does is he begins to tell us about these three videos
this is this fantastic brat pack remix set to lisztomania
which of course spread virally
hugely successful
and then some people from brooklyn saw it
they decided they wanted to do the same
and then of course people from san fransisco saw it
and san franciscans thought they had to do the same as well
and so they 're beautiful but this libertarian has some important lessons he wants us to learn from this
here 's lesson number one
js there 's obviously also something really deeply great about this
they are acting in the sense that they 're emulating the original mashup
and the guy who shot it obviously has a strong eye and some experience with video editing
but this is also basically just a group of friends having an authentic social moment and screwing around together
it should feel familiar and kind of resonate for anyone who 's had a sing-a-long or a dance party with a group of good friends
ll or ...
js so that 's importantly different from the earlier videos we looked at because here remix isn 't just about an individual doing something alone in his basement it becomes an act of social creativity
and it 's not just that it yields a different kind of product at the end it 's that potentially it changes the way that we relate to each other
all of our normal social interactions become a kind of invitation to this sort of collective expression
it 's our real social lives themselves that are transmuted into art
ll and so then what this libertarian draws from these two points ...
js one remix is about individuals using our shared culture as a kind of language to communicate something to an audience
stage two social remix is really about using it to mediate people 's relationships to each other
first within each video the brat pack characters are used as a kind of template for performing the social reality of each group
but there 's also a dialogue between the videos where once the basic structure is established it becomes a kind of platform for articulating the similarities and differences between the groups social and physical worlds
ll and then here 's for me the critical key to what julian has to say ...
js copyright policy isn 't just about how to incentivize the production of a certain kind of artistic commodity it 's about what level of control we 're going to permit to be exercised over our social realities social realities that are now inevitably permeated by pop culture
i think it 's important that we keep these two different kinds of public goods in mind
if we 're only focused on how to maximize the supply of one i think we risk suppressing this different and richer and in some ways maybe even more important one
ll right bingo point
freedom needs this opportunity to both have the commercial success of the great commercial works and the opportunity to build this different kind of culture
and for that to happen you need ideas like fair use to be central and protected to enable this kind of innovation as this libertarian tells us between these two creative cultures a commercial and a sharing culture
the point is they he here gets that culture
now my concern is we dems too often not so much
all right take for example this great company
in the good old days when this republican ran that company their greatest work was work that built on the past right
all of the great disney works were works that took works that were in the public domain and remixed them or waited until they entered the public domain to remix them to celebrate this add-on remix creativity
indeed mickey mouse himself of course as steamboat willie is a remix of the then very dominant very popular steamboat bill by buster keaton
this man was a remixer extraordinaire
he is the celebration and ideal of exactly this kind of creativity
but then the company passes through this dark stage to this democrat
wildly different
this is the mastermind behind the eventual passage of what we call the sonny bono copyright term extension act extending the term of existing copyrights by 20 years so that no one could do to disney what disney did to the brothers grimm
now when we tried to challenge this going to the supreme court getting the supreme court the bunch of conservatives there if we could get them to wake up to this to strike it down we had the assistance of nobel prize winners including this right-wing nobel prize winner milton friedman who said he would join our brief only if the word no brainer was in the brief somewhere
but apparently no brains existed in this place when democrats passed and signed this bill into law
now tiny little quibble of a footnote sonny bono you might say was a republican but i don 't buy it
this guy is no republican
okay for a second example think about this cultural hero icon on the left creator of this character
look at the site that he built star wars mashups inviting people to come and use their creative energy to produce a new generation of attention towards this extraordinarily important cultural icon
read the license
the license for these remixers assigns all of the rights to the remix back to lucas
the mashup is owned by lucas
indeed anything you add to the mashup music you might add lucas has a worldwide perpetual right to exploit that for free
there is no creator here to be recognized
the creator doesn 't have any rights
the creator is a sharecropper in this story
and we should remember who employed the sharecroppers the democrats right
so the point is the republicans here recognize that there 's a certain need of ownership a respect for ownership the respect we should give the creator the remixer the owner the property owner the copyright owner of this extraordinarily powerful stuff and not a generation of sharecroppers
now i think there are lessons we should learn here lessons about openness
our lives are sharing activities at least in part
even for the head of goldman sachs at least in part
and for that sharing activity to happen we have to have well-protected spaces of fair use
that 's number one number two this ecology of sharing needs freedom within which to create
freedom which means without permission from anyone the ability to create
and number three we need to respect the creator the creator of these remixes through rights that are directly tied to them
now this explains the right-wing nonprofit creative commons
actually it 's not a right-wing nonprofit but of course let me just tie it here the creative commons which is offering authors this simple way to mark their content with the freedoms they intended to carry
so that we go from a all rights reserved world to a some rights reserved world so that people can know the freedoms they have attached to the content building and creating on the basis of this creative copyrighted work
these tools that we built enable this sharing in parts through licenses that make it clear and a freedom to create without requiring permission first because the permission has already been granted and a respect for the creator because it builds upon a copyright the creator has licensed freely
and it explains the vast right-wing conspiracy that 's obviously developed around these licenses as now more than 350 million digital objects are out there licensed freely in this way
now that picture of an ecology of creativity the picture of an ecology of balanced creativity is that the ecology of creativity we have right now
well as you all know not many of us believe we do
i tripped on the reality of this ecology of creativity just last week
i created a video which was based on a wireside chat that i 'd given and i uploaded it to youtube
i then got this email from youtube weirdly notifying me that there was content in that owned by the mysterious wmg that matched their content id
so i didn 't think much about it
and then on twitter somebody said to me your talk on youtube was dmca 'd was that your purpose
imagining that i had this deep conspiracy to reveal the obvious flaws in the dmca
i answered no i didn 't even think about it
but then i went to the site and all of the audio in my site had been silenced
my whole 45-minute video had been silenced because there were snippets in that video a video about fair use that included warner music group music
now interestingly they still sold ads for that music if you played the silent video
you could still buy the music but you couldn 't hear anything because it had been silenced
so i did what the current regime says i must do to be free to use youtube to talk about fair use
i went to this site and i had to answer these questions
and then in an extraordinarily bart simpson-like juvenile way you 've actually got to type out these words and get them right to reassert your freedom to speak
and i felt like i was in third grade again
i will not put tacks on the teacher 's chair
i will not put tacks on the teacher 's chair
this is absurd
it is outrageous
it is an extraordinary perversion of the system of freedom we should be encouraging
and the question i ask you is who 's fighting it
well interestingly in the last presidential election who was the number one active opponent of this system of regulation in online speech
john mccain
letter after letter attacking youtube 's refusal to be more respectful of fair use with their extraordinary notice and take down system that led his campaign so many times to be thrown off the internet
now that was the story of me then my good old days of right-wing lunacy
let me come back to now now when i 'm a little leftist i 'm certainly left-handed so at least a lefty and i wonder can we on the left expect to build this ecology of freedom now in a world where we know the extraordinarily powerful influences against it where even icons of the left like this entertain and push bills that would effectively ban the requirement of open access for government-funded research
the president who has supported a process that secretly negotiates agreements which effectively lock us into the insane system of dmca that we have adopted and likely lock us down a path of three strikes you 're out that of course the rest of the world are increasingly adopting
not a single example of reform has been produced yet
and we 're not going to see this change in this system anytime soon
so here 's the lessons of openness that i think we need to learn
openness is a commitment to a certain set of values
we need to speak of those values
the value of freedom it 's a value of community
it 's a value of the limits in regulation
it 's a value respecting the creator
now if we can learn those values from at least some influences on the right if we can take them and incorporate them maybe we could do a little trade
we learn those values on the left and maybe they 'll do health care or global warming legislation or something in the right
anyway please join me in teaching these values
thank you very much

a few years ago my eyes were opened to the dark side of the construction industry
in 2006 young qatari students took me to go and see the migrant worker camps
and since then i 've followed the unfolding issue of worker rights
in the last six months more than 300 skyscrapers in the uae have been put on hold or canceled
behind the headlines that lay behind these buildings is the fate of the often-indentured construction worker
1.1 million of them
mainly indian pakistani sri lankan and nepalese these laborers risk everything to make money for their families back home
they pay a middle-man thousands of dollars to be there
and when they arrive they find themselves in labor camps with no water no air conditioning and their passports taken away
while it 's easy to point the finger at local officials and higher authorities 99 percent of these people are hired by the private sector and so therefore we 're equally if not more accountable
groups like buildsafe uae have emerged but the numbers are simply overwhelming
in august 2008 uae public officials noted that 40 percent of the country 's 1,098 labor camps had violated minimum health and fire safety regulations
and last summer more than 10,000 workers protested for the non-payment of wages for the poor quality of food and inadequate housing
and then the financial collapse happened
when the contractors have gone bust as they 've been overleveraged like everyone else the difference is everything goes missing documentation passports and tickets home for these workers
currently right now thousands of workers are abandoned
there is no way back home
and there is no way and no proof of arrival
these are the boom-and-bust refugees
the question is as a building professional as an architect an engineer as a developer if you know this is going on as we go to the sights every single week are you complacent or complicit in the human rights violations
so let 's forget your environmental footprint
let 's think about your ethical footprint
what good is it to build a zero-carbon energy efficient complex when the labor producing this architectural gem is unethical at best
now recently i 've been told i 've been taking the high road
but quite frankly on this issue there is no other road
so let 's not forget who is really paying the price of this financial collapse
and that as we worry about our next job in the office the next design that we can get to keep our workers
let 's not forget these men who are truly dying to work
thank you

let me tell you a story
it 's my first year as a new high school science teacher and i 'm so eager
i 'm so excited i 'm pouring myself into my lesson plans
but i 'm slowly coming to this horrifying realization that my students just might not be learning anything
this happens one day i 'd just assigned my class to read this textbook chapter about my favorite subject in all of biology viruses and how they attack
and so i 'm so excited to discuss this with them and i come in and i say can somebody please explain the main ideas and why this is so cool
there 's silence
finally my favorite student she looks me straight in the eye and she says the reading sucked
and then she clarified she said you know what i don 't mean that it sucks it means that i didn 't understand a word of it
it 's boring um who cares and it sucks
these sympathetic smiles spread all throughout the room now and i realize that all of my other students are in the same boat that maybe they took notes or they memorized definitions from the textbook but not one of them really understood the main ideas
not one of them can tell me why this stuff is so cool why it 's so important
i 'm totally clueless
i have no idea what to do next
so the only thing i can think of is say listen let me tell you a story
the main characters in the story are bacteria and viruses
these guys are blown up a couple million times
the real bacteria and viruses are so small we can 't see them without a microscope and you guys might know bacteria and viruses because they both make us sick
but what a lot of people don 't know is that viruses can also make bacteria sick
now the story that i start telling my kids it starts out like a horror story
once upon a time there 's this happy little bacterium
don 't get too attached to him
maybe he 's floating around in your stomach or in some spoiled food somewhere and all of a sudden he starts to not feel so good
maybe he ate something bad for lunch and then things get really horrible as his skin rips apart and he sees a virus coming out from his insides
and then it gets horrible when he bursts open and an army of viruses floods out from his insides
if ouch is right if you see this and you 're a bacterium this is like your worst nightmare
but if you 're a virus and you see this you cross those little legs of yours and you think we rock
because it took a lot of crafty work to infect this bacterium
here 's what had to happen
a virus grabbed onto a bacterium and it slipped its dna into it
the next thing is that virus dna made stuff that chopped up the bacteria dna
and now that we 've gotten rid of the bacteria dna the virus dna takes control of the cell and it tells it to start making more viruses
because you see dna is like a blueprint that tells living things what to make
so this is kind of like going into a car factory and replacing the blueprints with blueprints for killer robots
the workers still come the next day they do their job but they 're following different instructions
so replacing the bacteria dna with virus dna turns the bacteria into a factory for making viruses that is until it 's so filled with viruses that it bursts
but that 's not the only way that viruses infect bacteria
some are much more crafty
when a secret agent virus infects a bacterium they do a little espionage
here this cloaked secret agent virus is slipping his dna into the bacterial cell but here 's the kicker it doesn 't do anything harmful not at first
instead it silently slips into the bacteria 's own dna and it just stays there like a terrorist sleeper cell waiting for instructions
and what 's interesting about this is now whenever this bacteria has babies the babies also have the virus dna in them
so now we have a whole extended bacteria family filled with virus sleeper cells
they 're just happily living together until a signal happens and bam all of the dna pops out
it takes control of these cells turns them into virus-making factories and they all burst a huge extended bacteria family all dying with viruses spilling out of their guts the viruses taking over the bacterium
so now you understand how viruses can attack cells
there are two ways on the left is what we call the lytic way where the viruses go right in and take over the cells
on the [ right ] is the lysogenic way that uses secret agent viruses
so this stuff is not that hard right
and now all of you understand it
but if you 've graduated from high school i can almost guarantee you 've seen this information before
but i bet it was presented in a way that it didn 't exactly stick in your mind
so when my students were first learning this why did they hate it so much
well there were a couple of reasons
first of all i can guarantee you that their textbooks didn 't have secret agent viruses and they didn 't have horror stories
you know in the communication of science there is this obsession with seriousness
it kills me i 'm not kidding
i used to work for an educational publisher and as a writer i was always told never to use stories or fun engaging language because then my work might not be viewed as serious and scientific
right i mean because god forbid somebody have fun when they 're learning science
so we have this field of science that 's all about slime and color changes check this out
and then we have of course as any good scientist has to have explosions
but if a textbook seems too much fun it 's somehow unscientific
now another problem was that the language in their textbook was truly incomprehensible
if we want to summarize that story that i told you earlier we could start by saying something like these viruses make copies of themselves by slipping their dna into a bacterium
the way this showed up in the textbook it looked like this bacteriophage replication is initiated through the introduction of viral nucleic acid into a bacterium
that 's great perfect for 13-year-olds
but here 's the thing there are plenty of people in science education who would look at this and say there 's no way that we could ever give that to students because it contains some language that isn 't completely accurate
for example i told you that viruses have dna
well a very tiny fraction of them don 't
they have something called rna instead
so a professional science writer would circle that and say that has to go
we have to change it to something much more technical
and after a team of professional science editors went over this really simple explanation they 'd find fault with almost every word i 've used and they 'd have to change anything that wasn 't serious enough and they 'd have to change everything that wasn 't 100 percent perfect
then it would be accurate but it would be completely impossible to understand
this is horrifying
you know i keep talking about this idea of telling a story and it 's like science communication has taken on this idea of what i call the tyranny of precision where you can 't just tell a story
it 's like science has become that horrible storyteller that we all know who gives us all the details nobody cares about where you 're like oh i met my friend for lunch the other day and she was wearing these ugly jeans
i mean they weren 't really jeans they were more kind of like leggings but like i guess they 're actually kind of more like jeggings like but i think and you 're just like oh my god
what is the point
or even worse science education is becoming like that guy who always says actually
right you want to be like oh dude we had to get up in the middle of the night and drive a hundred miles in total darkness
and that guy 's like actually it was 87.3 miles
and you 're like actually shut up
i 'm just trying to tell a story
because good storytelling is all about emotional connection
we have to convince our audience that what we 're talking about matters
but just as important is knowing which details we should leave out so that the main point still comes across
i 'm reminded of what the architect mies van der rohe said and i paraphrase when he said that sometimes you have to lie in order to tell the truth
i think this sentiment is particularly relevant to science education
now finally i am often so disappointed when people think that i 'm advocating a dumbing down of science
that 's not true at all
i 'm currently a ph.d. student at mit and i absolutely understand the importance of detailed specific scientific communication between experts but not when we 're trying to teach 13-year-olds
if a young learner thinks that all viruses have dna that 's not going to ruin their chances of success in science
but if a young learner can 't understand anything in science and learns to hate it because it all sounds like this that will ruin their chances of success
this needs to stop and i wish that the change could come from the institutions at the top that are perpetuating these problems and i beg them i beseech them to just stop it
but i think that 's unlikely
so we are so lucky that we have resources like the internet where we can circumvent these institutions from the bottom up
there 's a growing number of online resources that are dedicated to just explaining science in simple understandable ways
i dream of a wikipedia-like website that would explain any scientific concept you can think of in simple language any middle schooler can understand
and i myself spend most of my free time making these science videos that i put on youtube
i explain chemical equilibrium using analogies to awkward middle school dances and i talk about fuel cells with stories about boys and girls at a summer camp
the feedback that i get is sometimes misspelled and it 's often written in lolcats but nonetheless it 's so appreciative so thankful that i know this is the right way we should be communicating science
there 's still so much work left to be done though and if you 're involved with science in any way i urge you to join me
pick up a camera start to write a blog whatever but leave out the seriousness leave out the jargon
make me laugh make me care
leave out those annoying details that nobody cares about and just get to the point
how should you start
why don 't you say listen let me tell you a story
thank you
what 's happening to the climate
it is unbelievably bad
this is obviously that famous view now of the arctic which is likely to be gone at this point in the next three or four or five years very very very scary
so we all look at what we can do
and when you look at the worldwide sources of co2 52 percent are tied to buildings
only nine percent is passenger cars interestingly enough
so we ran off to a sushi bar
and at that sushi bar we came up with a great idea
and it was something called ecorock
and we said we could redesign the 115-year-old gypsum drywall process that generates 20 billion pounds of co2 a year
so it was a big idea we wanted to reduce that by 80 percent which is exactly what we 've done
we started r & amp d in 2006
decided to use recycled content from cement and steel manufacturing
there is the inside of our lab we haven 't shown this before
but our people had to do some 5,000 different mixes to get this right to hit our targets
and they worked absolutely very very very hard
so then we went forward and built our production line in china
we don 't build this production equipment any longer in the u.s. unfortunately
we did the line install over the summer
we started right there with absolutely nothing
you 're seeing for the first time a brand new drywall production line not made using gypsum at all
that 's the finished production line there
we got our first panel out on december third
that is the slurry being poured onto paper basically that 's the line running
the exciting thing is look at the faces of the people
these are people who worked this project for two to three years
and they are so excited that 's the first board off the line
our vice president of operation kissing the board obviously very very excited
but this has a huge huge impact on the environment
we signed the first panel just a few weeks after that had a great signing ceremony leading to people hopefully using these products across the world
and we 've got cradle-to-cradle gold on this thing
we happened to win just recently the green product of the year for the re-invention of drywall from popular science
thank you thank you
so here is what we learned 8,000 gallons of gas equivalent to build one house
you probably had no idea it 's like driving around the world six times
we must change everything
look around the room chairs wood everything around us has to change or we 're not going to lick this problem
don 't listen to the people who say you can 't do this because anyone can
and these job losses we can fix them with green-collar jobs
we 've got four plants we 're building this stuff around the country
we 're going as fast as we can
two and a half million cars worth of gypsum you know co2 generated right
those are my kids natalie and david
when they have their kids 2050 they 'd better look back at grandpa and say hey you gave it a good shot you did the best you could with the team that you had
so my hope is that when you leave ted you will look at reducing your carbon footprint in however you can do it
and if you don 't know how please find me i will help you
last but not least bill gates i know you invented windows
wait till you see maybe next year what kind of windows we 've invented
thank you so much
hi i am an architect
i am the only architect in the world making buildings out of paper like this cardboard tube and this exhibition is the first one i did using paper tubes
1986 much much longer before people started talking about ecological issues and environmental issues i just started testing the paper tube in order to use this as a building structure
it 's very complicated to test the new material for the building but this is much stronger than i expected and also it 's very easy to waterproof and also because it 's industrial material it 's also possible to fireproof
then i built the temporary structure 1990
this is the first temporary building made out of paper
there are 330 tubes diameter 55 [ centimeters ] there are only 12 tubes with a diameter of 120 centimeters or four feet wide
as you see it in the photo inside is the toilet
in case you 're finished with toilet paper you can tear off the inside of the wall
so it 's very useful
year 2000 there was a big expo in germany
i was asked to design the building because the theme of the expo was environmental issues
so i was chosen to build the pavilion out of paper tubes recyclable paper
my goal of the design is not when it 's completed
my goal was when the building was demolished because each country makes a lot of pavilions but after half a year we create a lot of industrial waste so my building has to be reused or recycled
after the building was recycled
so that was the goal of my design
then i was very lucky to win the competition to build the second pompidou center in france in the city of metz
because i was so poor i wanted to rent an office in paris but i couldn 't afford it so i decided to bring my students to paris to build our office on top of the pompidou center in paris by ourselves
so we brought the paper tubes and the wooden joints to complete the 35-meter-long office
we stayed there for six years without paying any rent
thank you i had one big problem
because we were part of the exhibition even if my friend wanted to see me they had to buy a ticket to see me
that was the problem
then i completed the pompidou center in metz
it 's a very popular museum now and i created a big monument for the government
but then i was very disappointed at my profession as an architect because we are not helping we are not working for society but we are working for privileged people rich people government developers
they have money and power
those are invisible
so they hire us to visualize their power and money by making monumental architecture
that is our profession even historically it 's the same even now we are doing the same
so i was very disappointed that we are not working for society even though there are so many people who lost their houses by natural disasters
but i must say they are no longer natural disasters
for example earthquakes never kill people but collapse of the buildings kill people
that 's the responsibility of architects
then people need some temporary housing but there are no architects working there because we are too busy working for privileged people
so i thought even as architects we can be involved in the reconstruction of temporary housing
we can make it better
so that is why i started working in disaster areas
1994 there was a big disaster in rwanda africa
two tribes hutu and tutsi fought each other
over two million people became refugees
but i was so surprised to see the shelter refugee camp organized by the u.n.
they 're so poor and they are freezing with blankets during the rainy season in the shelters built by the u.n. they were just providing a plastic sheet and the refugees had to cut the trees and just like this
but over two million people cut trees
it just became big heavy deforestation and an environmental problem
that is why they started providing aluminum pipes aluminum barracks
very expensive they throw them out for money then cutting trees again
so i proposed my idea to improve the situation using these recycled paper tubes because this is so cheap and also so strong but my budget is only 50 u.s. dollars per unit
we built 50 units to do that as a monitoring test for the durability and moisture and termites so on
and then year afterward 1995 in kobe japan we had a big earthquake
nearly 7,000 people were killed and the city like this nagata district all the city was burned in a fire after the earthquake
and also i found out there 's many vietnamese refugees suffering and gathering at a catholic church all the building was totally destroyed
so i went there and also i proposed to the priests why don 't we rebuild the church out of paper tubes
and he said oh god are you crazy
after a fire what are you proposing
so he never trusted me but i didn 't give up
i started commuting to kobe and i met the society of vietnamese people
they were living like this with very poor plastic sheets in the park
so i proposed to rebuild i raised did fundraising
i made a paper tube shelter for them and in order to make it easy to be built by students and also easy to demolish i used beer crates as a foundation
i asked the kirin beer company to propose because at that time the asahi beer company made their plastic beer crates red which doesn 't go with the color of the paper tubes
the color coordination is very important
and also i still remember we were expecting to have a beer inside the plastic beer crate but it came empty
so i remember it was so disappointing
so during the summer with my students we built over 50 units of the shelters
finally the priest finally he trusted me to rebuild
he said as long as you collect money by yourself bring your students to build you can do it
so we spent five weeks rebuilding the church
it was meant to stay there for three years but actually it stayed there 10 years because people loved it
then in taiwan they had a big earthquake and we proposed to donate this church so we dismantled them we sent them over to be built by volunteer people
it stayed there in taiwan as a permanent church even now
so this building became a permanent building
then i wonder what is a permanent and what is a temporary building
even a building made in paper can be permanent as long as people love it
even a concrete building can be very temporary if that is made to make money
in 1999 in turkey the big earthquake i went there to use the local material to build a shelter
2001 in west india i built also a shelter
in 2004 in sri lanka after the sumatra earthquake and tsunami i rebuilt islamic fishermen 's villages
and in 2008 in chengdu sichuan area in china nearly 70,000 people were killed and also especially many of the schools were destroyed because of the corruption between the authority and the contractor
i was asked to rebuild the temporary church
i brought my japanese students to work with the chinese students
in one month we completed nine classrooms over 500 square meters
it 's still used even after the current earthquake in china
in 2009 in italy l 'aquila also they had a big earthquake
and this is a very interesting photo former prime minister berlusconi and japanese former former former former prime minister mr. aso you know because we have to change the prime minister ever year
and they are very kind affording my model
i proposed a big rebuilding a temporary music hall because l 'aquila is very famous for music and all the concert halls were destroyed so musicians were moving out
so i proposed to the mayor i 'd like to rebuild the temporary auditorium
he said as long as you bring your money you can do it
and i was very lucky
mr. berlusconi brought g8 summit and our former prime minister came so they helped us to collect money and i got half a million euros from the japanese government to rebuild this temporary auditorium
year 2010 in haiti there was a big earthquake but it 's impossible to fly over so i went to santo domingo next-door country to drive six hours to get to haiti with the local students in santo domingo to build 50 units of shelter out of local paper tubes
this is what happened in japan two years ago in northern japan
after the earthquake and tsunami people had to be evacuated in a big room like a gymnasium
but look at this there 's no privacy
people suffer mentally and physically
so we went there to build partitions with all the student volunteers with paper tubes just a very simple shelter out of the tube frame and the curtain
however some of the facility authority doesn 't want us to do it because they said simply it 's become more difficult to control them
but it 's really necessary to do it
they don 't have enough flat area to build standard government single-story housing like this one
look at this even civil government is doing such poor construction of the temporary housing so dense and so messy because there is no storage nothing water is leaking so i thought we have to make multi-story building because there 's no land and also it 's not very comfortable
so i proposed to the mayor while i was making partitions
finally i met a very nice mayor in onagawa village in miyagi
he asked me to build three-story housing on baseball [ fields ]
i used the shipping container and also the students helped us to make all the building furniture to make them comfortable within the budget of the government but also the area of the house is exactly the same but much more comfortable
many of the people want to stay here forever
i was very happy to hear that
now i am working in new zealand christchurch
about 20 days before the japanese earthquake happened also they had a big earthquake and many japanese students were also killed and the most important cathedral of the city the symbol of christchurch was totally destroyed
and i was asked to come to rebuild the temporary cathedral
so this is under construction
and i 'd like to keep building monuments that are beloved by people
thank you very much
thank you
thank you very much
i have 18 minutes to tell you what happened over the past six million years
all right
we all have come from a long way here in africa and converged in this region of africa which is a place where 90 percent of our evolutionary process took place
and i say that not because i am african but it 's in africa that you find the earliest evidence for human ancestors upright walking traces even the first technologies in the form of stone tools
so we all are africans and welcome home
all right
i 'm a paleoanthropologist and my job is to define man 's place in nature and explore what makes us human
and today i will use selam the earliest child ever discovered to tell you a story of all of us
selam is our most complete skeleton of a three-year-old girl who lived and died 3.3 million years ago
she belongs to the species known as australopithecus afarensis
you don 't need to remember that
that 's the lucy species and was found by my research team in december of 2000 in an area called dikika
it 's in the northeastern part of ethiopia
and selam means peace in many ethiopian languages
we use that name to celebrate peace in the region and in the planet
and the fact that it was the cover story of all these famous magazines gives you already an idea of her significance i think
after i was invited by ted i did some digging because that 's what we do to know about my host
you don 't just jump into an invitation
and i learned that the first technology appeared in the form of stone tools 2.6 million years ago
first entertainment comes evidence from flutes that are 35,000 years old
and evidence for first design comes 75,000 years old beads
and you can do the same with your genes and track them back in time
and dna analysis of living humans and chimpanzees teaches us today that we diverged sometime around seven million years ago and that these two species share over 98 percent of the same genetic material
i think knowing this is a very useful context within which we can think of our ancestry
however dna analysis informs us only about the beginning and the end telling us nothing about what happened in the middle
so for us paleoanthropologists our job is to find the hard evidence the fossil evidence to fill in this gap and see the different stages of development
because it 's only when you do that that you can talk about it 's only when you do that [ that ] you can talk about how we looked like and how we behaved at different times and how those likes and looks and behaviors changed through time
that then gives you an access to explore the biological mechanisms and forces that are responsible for this gradual change that made us what we are today
but finding the hard evidence is a very complicated endeavor
it 's a systematic and scientific approach which takes you to places that are remote hot hostile and often with no access
just to give you an example when i went to dikika where selam was found in 99 and it 's about 500 kilometers from addis ababa the capital of ethiopia
it took us only seven hours to do the first 470 kilometers of the 500 but took four solid hours to do the last only 30 kilometers
with the help of the locals and using just shovels and picks i made my way
i was the first person to actually drive a car to the spot
when you get there this is what you see and it 's the vastness of the place which makes you feel helpless and vulnerable
and once you make it there the big question is where to start
and you find nothing for years and years
when i go to places like this which are paleontological sites it 's like going to a game park an extinct game park
but what you find are not the human remains such as selam and lucy on a day-to-day basis
you find elephants rhinos monkeys pigs etc
but you could ask how could these large mammals live in this desert environment
of course they cannot but i 'm telling you already that the environment and the carrying capacity of this region was drastically different from what we have today
a very important environmental lesson could be learned from this
anyway once we made it there then it 's a game park as i said an extinct game park
and our ancestors lived in that game park but were just the minorities they were not as successful and as widespread as the homo sapiens that we are
to tell you just an example an anecdote about their rarity i was going to this place every year and would do fieldwork here and the assistants of course helped me do the surveys
they would find a bone and tell me here is what you 're looking for
i would say no that 's an elephant
again another one that 's a monkey that 's a pig etc
so one of my assistants who never went to school said to me listen zeray
you either don 't know what you 're looking for or you 're looking in the wrong place he said
and i said why because there were elephants and lions and the people were scared and went somewhere else
let 's go somewhere else
well he was very tired and it 's really tiring
it was then after such hard work and many frustrating years that we found selam and you see the face here covered by sandstone
and here is actually the spinal column and the whole torso encased in a sandstone block because she was buried by a river
what you have here seems to be nothing but contains an incredible amount of scientific information that helps us explore what makes us human
this is the earliest and most complete juvenile human ancestor ever found in the history of paleoanthropology an amazing piece of our long long history
there were these three people and me and i am taking the pictures that 's why i am not in
how would you feel if you were me you have something extraordinary in your hand but you are in the middle of nowhere
the feeling i had was a deep and quiet happiness and excitement of course accompanied by a huge sense of responsibility of making sure everything is safe
here is a close-up of the fossil after five years of cleaning preparation and description which was very long as i had to expose the bones from the sandstone block i just showed you in the previous slide
it took five years
in a way this was like the second birth for the child after 3.3 million years but the labor was very long
and here is full scale it 's a tiny bone
and in the middle is the minister of ethiopian tourism who came to visit the national museum of ethiopia while i was working there
and you see me worried and trying to protect my child because you don 't leave anyone with this kind of child even a minister
so then once you 've done that the next stage is to know what it is
once that was done then it was possible to compare
we were able to tell that she belonged to the human family tree because the legs the foot and some features clearly showed that she walked upright and upright walking is a hallmark in humanity
but in addition if you compare the skull with a comparably aged chimpanzee and little george bush here you see that you have vertical forehead
and you see that in humans because of the development of the pre-frontal cortex it 's called
you don 't see that in chimpanzees and you don 't see this very projecting canine
so she belongs to our family tree but within that of course you do detailed analysis and we know now that she belongs to the lucy species known as australopithecus afarensis
the next exciting question is girl or boy
and how old was she when she died
you can determine the sex of the individual based on the size of the teeth
how
you know in primates there is this phenomenon called sexual dimorphism which simply means males are larger than females and males have larger teeth than the females
but to do that you need the permanent dentition which you don 't see here because what you have here are the baby teeth
but using the ct scanning technology which is normally used for medical purposes you can go deep into the mouth and come up with this beautiful image showing you both the baby teeth here and the still-growing adult teeth here
so when you measure those teeth it was clear that she turned out to be a girl with very small canine teeth
and to know how old she was when she died what you do is you do an informed estimate and you say how much time would be required to form this amount of teeth and the answer was three
so this girl died when she was about three 3.3 million years ago
so with all that information the big question is what do we actually what does she tell us
to answer this question we can phrase another question
what do we actually know about our ancestors
we want to know how they looked like how they behaved how they walked around and how they lived and grew up
and among the answers that you can get from this skeleton are included first this skeleton documents for the first time how infants looked over three million years ago
and second she tells us that she walked upright but had some adaptation for tree climbing
and more interesting however is the brain in this child was still growing
at age three if you have a still-growing brain it 's a human behavior
in chimps by age three the brain is formed over 90 percent
that 's why they can cope with their environment very easily after birth faster than us anyway
but in humans we continue to grow our brains
that 's why we need care from our parents
but that care means also you learn
you spend more time with your parents
and that 's very characteristic of humans and it 's called childhood which is this extended dependence of human children on their family or parents
so the still-growing brain in this individual tells us that childhood which requires an incredible social organization a very complex social organization emerged over three million years ago
so by being at the cusp of our evolutionary history selam unites us all and gives us a unique account on what makes us human
but not everything was human and i will give you a very exciting example
this is called the hyoid bone it 's a bone which is right here
it supports your tongue from behind
it 's in a way your voice box
it determines the type of voice you produce
it was not known in the fossil record and we have it in this skeleton
when we did the analysis of this bone it was clear that it looked very chimp-like chimpanzee-like
so if you were there 3.3 million years ago to hear when this girl was crying out for her mother she would have sounded more like a chimpanzee than a human
maybe you 're wondering so you see this ape feature human feature ape feature
what does that tell us
you know that is very exciting for us because it demonstrates that things were changing slowly and progressively and that evolution is in the making
to summarize the significance of this fossil we can say the following
up to now the knowledge that we had about our ancestors came essentially from adult individuals because the fossils the baby fossils were missing
they don 't preserve well as you know
so the knowledge that we had about our ancestors on how they looked like how they behaved was kind of biased toward adults
imagine somebody coming from mars and his job is to report on the type of people occupying our planet earth and you hide all the babies the children and he goes back and reports
can you imagine how much biased his report would be
that 's what somehow we were doing so far in the absence of the fossil children so i think the new fossil fixes this problem
so i think the most important question at the end is what do we actually learn from specimens like this and from our past in general
of course in addition to extracting this huge amount of scientific information as to what makes us human you know the many human ancestors that have existed over the past six million years and there are more than 10 they did not have the knowledge the technology and sophistications that we homo sapiens have today
but if this species ancient species would travel in time and see us today they would very much be very proud of their legacy because they became the ancestors of the most successful species in the universe
and they were probably not aware of this future legacy but they did great
now the question is we homo sapiens today are in a position to decide about the future of our planet possibly more
so the question is are we up to the challenge
and can we really do better than these primitive small-brained ancestors
among the most pressing challenges that our species is faced with today are the chronic problems of africa
needless to list them here and there are more competent people to talk about this
still in my opinion we have two choices
one is to continue to see a poor ill crying africa carrying guns that depends on other people forever or to promote an africa which is confident peaceful independent but cognizant of its huge problems and great values at the same time
i am for the second option and i 'm sure many of you are
and the key is to promote a positive african attitude towards africa
that 's because we africans concentrate i am from ethiopia by the way we concentrate too much on how we are seen from elsewhere or from outside
i think it 's important to promote in a more positive way on how we see ourselves
that 's what i call positive african attitude
so finally i would like to say so let 's help africa walk upright and forward then we all can be proud of our future legacy as a species
thank you
when we park in a big parking lot how do we remember where we parked our car
here 's the problem facing homer
and we 're going to try to understand what 's happening in his brain
so we 'll start with the hippocampus shown in yellow which is the organ of memory
if you have damage there like in alzheimer 's you can 't remember things including where you parked your car
it 's named after latin for seahorse which it resembles
and like the rest of the brain it 's made of neurons
so the human brain has about a hundred billion neurons in it
and the neurons communicate with each other by sending little pulses or spikes of electricity via connections to each other
the hippocampus is formed of two sheets of cells which are very densely interconnected
and scientists have begun to understand how spatial memory works by recording from individual neurons in rats or mice while they forage or explore an environment looking for food
so we 're going to imagine we 're recording from a single neuron in the hippocampus of this rat here
and when it fires a little spike of electricity there 's going to be a red dot and a click
so what we see is that this neuron knows whenever the rat has gone into one particular place in its environment
and it signals to the rest of the brain by sending a little electrical spike
so we could show the firing rate of that neuron as a function of the animal 's location
and if we record from lots of different neurons we 'll see that different neurons fire when the animal goes in different parts of its environment like in this square box shown here
so together they form a map for the rest of the brain telling the brain continually where am i now within my environment
place cells are also being recorded in humans
so epilepsy patients sometimes need the electrical activity in their brain monitoring
and some of these patients played a video game where they drive around a small town
and place cells in their hippocampi would fire become active start sending electrical impulses whenever they drove through a particular location in that town
so how does a place cell know where the rat or person is within its environment
well these two cells here show us that the boundaries of the environment are particularly important
so the one on the top likes to fire sort of midway between the walls of the box that their rat 's in
and when you expand the box the firing location expands
the one below likes to fire whenever there 's a wall close by to the south
and if you put another wall inside the box then the cell fires in both place wherever there 's a wall to the south as the animal explores around in its box
so this predicts that sensing the distances and directions of boundaries around you extended buildings and so on is particularly important for the hippocampus
and indeed on the inputs to the hippocampus cells are found which project into the hippocampus which do respond exactly to detecting boundaries or edges at particular distances and directions from the rat or mouse as it 's exploring around
so the cell on the left you can see it fires whenever the animal gets near to a wall or a boundary to the east whether it 's the edge or the wall of a square box or the circular wall of the circular box or even the drop at the edge of a table which the animals are running around
and the cell on the right there fires whenever there 's a boundary to the south whether it 's the drop at the edge of the table or a wall or even the gap between two tables that are pulled apart
so that 's one way in which we think place cells determine where the animal is as it 's exploring around
we can also test where we think objects are like this goal flag in simple environments or indeed where your car would be
so we can have people explore an environment and see the location they have to remember
and then if we put them back in the environment generally they 're quite good at putting a marker down where they thought that flag or their car was
but on some trials we could change the shape and size of the environment like we did with the place cell
in that case we can see how where they think the flag had been changes as a function of how you change the shape and size of the environment
and what you see for example if the flag was where that cross was in a small square environment and then if you ask people where it was but you 've made the environment bigger where they think the flag had been stretches out in exactly the same way that the place cell firing stretched out
it 's as if you remember where the flag was by storing the pattern of firing across all of your place cells at that location and then you can get back to that location by moving around so that you best match the current pattern of firing of your place cells with that stored pattern
that guides you back to the location that you want to remember
but we also know where we are through movement
so if we take some outbound path perhaps we park and we wander off we know because our own movements which we can integrate over this path roughly what the heading direction is to go back
and place cells also get this kind of path integration input from a kind of cell called a grid cell
now grid cells are found again on the inputs to the hippocampus and they 're a bit like place cells
but now as the rat explores around each individual cell fires in a whole array of different locations which are laid out across the environment in an amazingly regular triangular grid
and if you record from several grid cells shown here in different colors each one has a grid-like firing pattern across the environment and each cell 's grid-like firing pattern is shifted slightly relative to the other cells
so the red one fires on this grid and the green one on this one and the blue on on this one
so together it 's as if the rat can put a virtual grid of firing locations across its environment a bit like the latitude and longitude lines that you 'd find on a map but using triangles
and as it moves around the electrical activity can pass from one of these cells to the next cell to keep track of where it is so that it can use its own movements to know where it is in its environment
do people have grid cells
well because all of the grid-like firing patterns have the same axes of symmetry the same orientations of grid shown in orange here it means that the net activity of all of the grid cells in a particular part of the brain should change according to whether we 're running along these six directions or running along one of the six directions in between
so we can put people in an mri scanner and have them do a little video game like the one i showed you and look for this signal
and indeed you do see it in the human entorhinal cortex which is the same part of the brain that you see grid cells in rats
so back to homer
he 's probably remembering where his car was in terms of the distances and directions to extended buildings and boundaries around the location where he parked
and that would be represented by the firing of boundary-detecting cells
he 's also remembering the path he took out of the car park which would be represented in the firing of grid cells
now both of these kinds of cells can make the place cells fire
and he can return to the location where he parked by moving so as to find where it is that best matches the firing pattern of the place cells in his brain currently with the stored pattern where he parked his car
and that guides him back to that location irrespective of visual cues like whether his car 's actually there
maybe it 's been towed
but he knows where it was so he knows to go and get it
so beyond spatial memory if we look for this grid-like firing pattern throughout the whole brain we see it in a whole series of locations which are always active when we do all kinds of autobiographical memory tasks like remembering the last time you went to a wedding for example
so it may be that the neural mechanisms for representing the space around us are also used for generating visual imagery so that we can recreate the spatial scene at least of the events that have happened to us when we want to imagine them
so if this was happening your memories could start by place cells activating each other via these dense interconnections and then reactivating boundary cells to create the spatial structure of the scene around your viewpoint
and grid cells could move this viewpoint through that space
another kind of cell head direction cells which i didn 't mention yet they fire like a compass according to which way you 're facing
they could define the viewing direction from which you want to generate an image for your visual imagery so you can imagine what happened when you were at this wedding for example
so this is just one example of a new era really in cognitive neuroscience where we 're beginning to understand psychological processes like how you remember or imagine or even think in terms of the actions of the billions of individual neurons that make up our brains
thank you very much
isadora duncan crazy long-legged woman from san francisco got tired of this country and she wanted to get out
isadora was famous somewhere around 1908 for putting up a blue curtain and she would stand with her hands over her solar plexus and she would wait and she would wait and then she would move
josh and i and somi call this piece the red circle and the blue curtain
red circle
blue curtain
but this is not the beginning of the 20th century
this is a morning in vancouver in 2015
come on josh
go
are we there yet
i don 't think so
hey yeah
what time is it
where are we
josh
somi
bill t .
josh
somi
bill t .
yeah yeah
what i thought i would do is i would start with a simple request
i 'd like all of you to pause for a moment you wretched weaklings and take stock of your miserable existence
now that was the advice that st. benedict gave his rather startled followers in the fifth century
it was the advice that i decided to follow myself when i turned 40
up until that moment i had been that classic corporate warrior i was eating too much i was drinking too much i was working too hard and i was neglecting the family
and i decided that i would try and turn my life around
in particular i decided i would try to address the thorny issue of work-life balance
so i stepped back from the workforce and i spent a year at home with my wife and four young children
but all i learned about work-life balance from that year was that i found it quite easy to balance work and life when i didn 't have any work
not a very useful skill especially when the money runs out
so i went back to work and i 've spent these seven years since struggling with studying and writing about work-life balance
and i have four observations i 'd like to share with you today
the first is if society 's to make any progress on this issue we need an honest debate
but the trouble is so many people talk so much rubbish about work-life balance
all the discussions about flexi-time or dress-down fridays or paternity leave only serve to mask the core issue which is that certain job and career choices are fundamentally incompatible with being meaningfully engaged on a day-to-day basis with a young family
now the first step in solving any problem is acknowledging the reality of the situation you 're in
and the reality of the society that we 're in is there are thousands and thousands of people out there leading lives of quiet screaming desperation where they work long hard hours at jobs they hate to enable them to buy things they don 't need to impress people they don 't like
it 's my contention that going to work on friday in jeans and [ a ] t-shirt isn 't really getting to the nub of the issue
the second observation i 'd like to make is we need to face the truth that governments and corporations aren 't going to solve this issue for us
we should stop looking outside
it 's up to us as individuals to take control and responsibility for the type of lives that we want to lead
if you don 't design your life someone else will design it for you and you may just not like their idea of balance
it 's particularly important this isn 't on the world wide web is it i 'm about to get fired it 's particularly important that you never put the quality of your life in the hands of a commercial corporation
now i 'm not talking here just about the bad companies the abattoirs of the human soul as i call them
i 'm talking about all companies
because commercial companies are inherently designed to get as much out of you [ as ] they can get away with
it 's in their nature it 's in their dna it 's what they do even the good well-intentioned companies
on the one hand putting childcare facilities in the workplace is wonderful and enlightened
on the other hand it 's a nightmare it just means you spend more time at the bloody office
we have to be responsible for setting and enforcing the boundaries that we want in our life
the third observation is we have to be careful with the time frame that we choose upon which to judge our balance
before i went back to work after my year at home i sat down and i wrote out a detailed step-by-step description of the ideal balanced day that i aspired to
and it went like this wake up well rested after a good night 's sleep
have sex
walk the dog
have breakfast with my wife and children
have sex again
drive the kids to school on the way to the office
do three hours work
play a sport with a friend at lunchtime
do another three hours work
meet some mates in the pub for an early evening drink
drive home for dinner with my wife and kids
meditate for half an hour
have sex
walk the dog have sex again
go to bed
how often do you think i have that day
we need to be realistic
you can 't do it all in one day
we need to elongate the time frame upon which we judge the balance in our life but we need to elongate it without falling into the trap of the i 'll have a life when i retire when my kids have left home when my wife has divorced me my health is failing i 've got no mates or interests left
a day is too short after i retire is too long
there 's got to be a middle way
a fourth observation we need to approach balance in a balanced way
a friend came to see me last year and she doesn 't mind me telling this story a friend came to see me last year and said nigel i 've read your book
and i realize that my life is completely out of balance
it 's totally dominated by work
i work 10 hours a day i commute two hours a day
all of my relationships have failed
there 's nothing in my life apart from my work
so i 've decided to get a grip and sort it out
so i joined a gym
now i don 't mean to mock but being a fit 10-hour-a-day office rat isn 't more balanced it 's more fit
lovely though physical exercise may be there are other parts to life there 's the intellectual side there 's the emotional side there 's the spiritual side
and to be balanced i believe we have to attend to all of those areas not just do 50 stomach crunches
now that can be daunting
because people say bloody hell mate i haven 't got time to get fit
you want me to go to church and call my mother
and i understand
i truly understand how that can be daunting
but an incident that happened a couple of years ago gave me a new perspective
my wife who is somewhere in the audience today called me up at the office and said nigel you need to pick our youngest son harry up from school
because she had to be somewhere else with the other three children for that evening
so i left work an hour early that afternoon and picked harry up at the school gates
we walked down to the local park messed around on the swings played some silly games
i then walked him up the hill to the local cafe and we shared a pizza for two then walked down the hill to our home and i gave him his bath and put him in his batman pajamas
i then read him a chapter of roald dahl 's james and the giant peach
i then put him to bed tucked him in gave him a kiss on his forehead and said goodnight mate and walked out of his bedroom
as i was walking out of his bedroom he said dad i went yes mate
he went dad this has been the best day of my life ever
i hadn 't done anything hadn 't taken him to disney world or bought him a playstation
now my point is the small things matter
being more balanced doesn 't mean dramatic upheaval in your life
with the smallest investment in the right places you can radically transform the quality of your relationships and the quality of your life
moreover i think it can transform society
because if enough people do it we can change society 's definition of success away from the moronically simplistic notion that the person with the most money when he dies wins to a more thoughtful and balanced definition of what a life well lived looks like
and that i think is an idea worth spreading
i 'm going to speak today about the relationship between science and human values
now it 's generally understood that questions of morality questions of good and evil and right and wrong are questions about which science officially has no opinion
it 's thought that science can help us get what we value but it can never tell us what we ought to value
and consequently most people i think most people probably here think that science will never answer the most important questions in human life questions like what is worth living for
what is worth dying for
what constitutes a good life
so i 'm going to argue that this is an illusion that the separation between science and human values is an illusion and actually quite a dangerous one at this point in human history
now it 's often said that science cannot give us a foundation for morality and human values because science deals with facts and facts and values seem to belong to different spheres
it 's often thought that there 's no description of the way the world is that can tell us how the world ought to be
but i think this is quite clearly untrue
values are a certain kind of fact
they are facts about the well-being of conscious creatures
why is it that we don 't have ethical obligations toward rocks
why don 't we feel compassion for rocks
it 's because we don 't think rocks can suffer and if we 're more concerned about our fellow primates than we are about insects as indeed we are it 's because we think they 're exposed to a greater range of potential happiness and suffering
now the crucial thing to notice here is that this is a factual claim this is something that we could be right or wrong about and if we have misconstrued the relationship between biological complexity and the possibilities of experience well then we could be wrong about the inner lives of insects
and there 's no notion no version of human morality and human values that i 've ever come across that is not at some point reducible to a concern about conscious experience and its possible changes
even if you get your values from religion even if you think that good and evil ultimately relate to conditions after death either to an eternity of happiness with god or an eternity of suffering in hell you are still concerned about consciousness and its changes
and to say that such changes can persist after death is itself a factual claim which of course may or may not be true
now to speak about the conditions of well-being in this life for human beings we know that there is a continuum of such facts
we know that it 's possible to live in a failed state where everything that can go wrong does go wrong where mothers cannot feed their children where strangers cannot find the basis for peaceful collaboration where people are murdered indiscriminately
and we know that it 's possible to move along this continuum towards something quite a bit more idyllic to a place where a conference like this is even conceivable
and we know we know that there are right and wrong answers to how to move in this space
would adding cholera to the water be a good idea
probably not
would it be a good idea for everyone to believe in the evil eye so that when bad things happened to them they immediately blame their neighbors probably not
there are truths to be known about how human communities flourish whether or not we understand these truths
and morality relates to these truths
so in talking about values we are talking about facts
now of course our situation in the world can be understood at many levels from the level of the genome on up to the level of economic systems and political arrangements
but if we 're going to talk about human well-being we are of necessity talking about the human brain
because we know that our experience of the world and of ourselves within it is realized in the brain whatever happens after death
even if the suicide bomber does get 72 virgins in the afterlife in this life his personality his rather unfortunate personality is the product of his brain
so the contributions of culture if culture changes us as indeed it does it changes us by changing our brains
and so therefore whatever cultural variation there is in how human beings flourish can at least in principle be understood in the context of a maturing science of the mind neuroscience psychology etc
so what i 'm arguing is that value 's reduced to facts to facts about the conscious experience of conscious beings
and we can therefore visualize a space of possible changes in the experience of these beings
and i think of this as kind of a moral landscape with peaks and valleys that correspond to differences in the well-being of conscious creatures both personal and collective
and one thing to notice is that perhaps there are states of human well-being that we rarely access that few people access
and these await our discovery
perhaps some of these states can be appropriately called mystical or spiritual
perhaps there are other states that we can 't access because of how our minds are structured but other minds possibly could access them
now let me be clear about what i 'm not saying i 'm not saying that science is guaranteed to map this space or that we will have scientific answers to every conceivable moral question
i don 't think for instance that you will one day consult a supercomputer to learn whether you should have a second child or whether we should bomb iran 's nuclear facilities or whether you can deduct the full cost of ted as a business expense
but if questions affect human well-being then they do have answers whether or not we can find them
and just admitting this just admitting that there are right and wrong answers to the question of how humans flourish will change the way we talk about morality and will change our expectations of human cooperation in the future
for instance there are 21 states in our country where corporal punishment in the classroom is legal where it is legal for a teacher to beat a child with a wooden board hard and raising large bruises and blisters and even breaking the skin
and hundreds of thousands of children incidentally are subjected to this every year
the locations of these enlightened districts i think will fail to surprise you
we 're not talking about connecticut
and the rationale for this behavior is explicitly religious
the creator of the universe himself has told us not to spare the rod lest we spoil the child this is in proverbs 13 and 20 and i believe 23
but we can ask the obvious question is it a good idea generally speaking to subject children to pain and violence and public humiliation as a way of encouraging healthy emotional development and good behavior
is there any doubt that this question has an answer and that it matters
now many of you might worry that the notion of well-being is truly undefined and seemingly perpetually open to be re-construed
and so how therefore can there be an objective notion of well-being
well consider by analogy the concept of physical health
the concept of physical health is undefined
as we just heard from michael specter it has changed over the years
when this statue was carved the average life expectancy was probably 30
it 's now around 80 in the developed world
there may come a time when we meddle with our genomes in such a way that not being able to run a marathon at age 200 will be considered a profound disability
people will send you donations when you 're in that condition
notice that the fact that the concept of health is open genuinely open for revision does not make it vacuous
the distinction between a healthy person and a dead one is about as clear and consequential as any we make in science
another thing to notice is there may be many peaks on the moral landscape there may be equivalent ways to thrive there may be equivalent ways to organize a human society so as to maximize human flourishing
now why wouldn 't this undermine an objective morality
well think of how we talk about food i would never be tempted to argue to you that there must be one right food to eat
there is clearly a range of materials that constitute healthy food
but there 's nevertheless a clear distinction between food and poison
the fact that there are many right answers to the question what is food
does not tempt us to say that there are no truths to be known about human nutrition
many people worry that a universal morality would require moral precepts that admit of no exceptions
so for instance if it 's really wrong to lie it must always be wrong to lie and if you can find an exception well then there 's no such thing as moral truth
why would we think this
consider by analogy the game of chess
now if you 're going to play good chess a principle like don 't lose your queen is very good to follow
but it clearly admits some exceptions
there are moments when losing your queen is a brilliant thing to do
there are moments when it is the only good thing you can do
and yet chess is a domain of perfect objectivity
the fact that there are exceptions here does not change that at all
now this brings us to the sorts of moves that people are apt to make in the moral sphere
consider the great problem of women 's bodies what to do about them
well this is one thing you can do about them you can cover them up
now it is the position generally speaking of our intellectual community that while we may not like this we might think of this as wrong in boston or palo alto who are we to say that the proud denizens of an ancient culture are wrong to force their wives and daughters to live in cloth bags
and who are we to say even that they 're wrong to beat them with lengths of steel cable or throw battery acid in their faces if they decline the privilege of being smothered in this way
well who are we not to say this
who are we to pretend that we know so little about human well-being that we have to be non-judgmental about a practice like this
i 'm not talking about voluntary wearing of a veil women should be able to wear whatever they want as far as i 'm concerned
but what does voluntary mean in a community where when a girl gets raped her father 's first impulse rather often is to murder her out of shame
just let that fact detonate in your brain for a minute your daughter gets raped and what you want to do is kill her
what are the chances that represents a peak of human flourishing
now to say this is not to say that we have got the perfect solution in our own society
for instance this is what it 's like to go to a newsstand almost anywhere in the civilized world
now granted for many men it may require a degree in philosophy to see something wrong with these images
but if we are in a reflective mood we can ask is this the perfect expression of psychological balance with respect to variables like youth and beauty and women 's bodies
i mean is this the optimal environment in which to raise our children
probably not ok so perhaps there 's some place on the spectrum between these two extremes that represents a place of better balance
perhaps there are many such places again given other changes in human culture there may be many peaks on the moral landscape
but the thing to notice is that there will be many more ways not to be on a peak
now the irony from my perspective is that the only people who seem to generally agree with me and who think that there are right and wrong answers to moral questions are religious demagogues of one form or another
and of course they think they have right answers to moral questions because they got these answers from a voice in a whirlwind not because they made an intelligent analysis of the causes and condition of human and animal well-being
in fact the endurance of religion as a lens through which most people view moral questions has separated most moral talk from real questions of human and animal suffering
this is why we spend our time talking about things like gay marriage and not about genocide or nuclear proliferation or poverty or any other hugely consequential issue
but the demagogues are right about one thing we need a universal conception of human values
now what stands in the way of this
well one thing to notice is that we do something different when talking about morality especially secular academic scientist types
when talking about morality we value differences of opinion in a way that we don 't in any other area of our lives
so for instance the dalai lama gets up every morning meditating on compassion and he thinks that helping other human beings is an integral component of human happiness
on the other hand we have someone like ted bundy ted bundy was very fond of abducting and raping and torturing and killing young women
so we appear to have a genuine difference of opinion about how to profitably use one 's time
most western intellectuals look at this situation and say well there 's nothing for the dalai lama to be really right about really right about or for ted bundy to be really wrong about that admits of a real argument that potentially falls within the purview of science
he likes chocolate he likes vanilla
there 's nothing that one should be able to say to the other that should persuade the other
notice that we don 't do this in science
on the left you have edward witten
he 's a string theorist
if you ask the smartest physicists around who is the smartest physicist around in my experience half of them will say ed witten
the other half will tell you they don 't like the question
so what would happen if i showed up at a physics conference and said string theory is bogus
it doesn 't resonate with me it 's not how i chose to view the universe at a small scale
i 'm not a fan
well nothing would happen because i 'm not a physicist i don 't understand string theory
i 'm the ted bundy of string theory
i wouldn 't want to belong to any string theory club that would have me as a member
but this is just the point
whenever we are talking about facts certain opinions must be excluded
that is what it is to have a domain of expertise
that is what it is for knowledge to count
how have we convinced ourselves that in the moral sphere there is no such thing as moral expertise or moral talent or moral genius even
how have we convinced ourselves that every opinion has to count
how have we convinced ourselves that every culture has a point of view on these subjects worth considering
does the taliban have a point of view on physics that is worth considering no
how is their ignorance any less obvious on the subject of human well-being
so this i think is what the world needs now
it needs people like ourselves to admit that there are right and wrong answers to questions of human flourishing and morality relates to that domain of facts
it is possible for individuals and even for whole cultures to care about the wrong things which is to say that it 's possible for them to have beliefs and desires that reliably lead to needless human suffering
just admitting this will transform our discourse about morality
we live in a world in which the boundaries between nations mean less and less and they will one day mean nothing
we live in a world filled with destructive technology and this technology cannot be uninvented it will always be easier to break things than to fix them
it seems to me therefore patently obvious that we can no more respect and tolerate vast differences in notions of human well-being than we can respect or tolerate vast differences in the notions about how disease spreads or in the safety standards of buildings and airplanes
we simply must converge on the answers we give to the most important questions in human life
and to do that we have to admit that these questions have answers
thank you very much
so some combustible material there
whether in this audience or people elsewhere in the world hearing some of this may well be doing the screaming-with-rage thing after as well some of them
language seems to be really important here
when you 're talking about the veil you 're talking about women dressed in cloth bags
i 've lived in the muslim world spoken with a lot of muslim women
and some of them would say something else they would say no you know this is a celebration of female specialness it helps build that and it 's a result of the fact that and this is arguably a sophisticated psychological view that male lust is not to be trusted
i mean can you engage in a conversation with that kind of woman without seeming kind of cultural imperialist
sam harris yeah well i think i tried to broach this in a sentence watching the clock ticking but the question is what is voluntary in a context where men have certain expectations and you 're guaranteed to be treated in a certain way if you don 't veil yourself
and so if anyone in this room wanted to wear a veil or a very funny hat or tattoo their face i think we should be free to voluntarily do whatever we want but we have to be honest about the constraints that these women are placed under
and so i think we shouldn 't be so eager to always take their word for it especially when it 's 120 degrees out and you 're wearing a full burqa
a lot of people want to believe in this concept of moral progress
but can you reconcile that
i think i understood you to say that you could reconcile that with a world that doesn 't become one dimensional where we all have to think the same
paint your picture of what rolling the clock 50 years forward 100 years forward how you would like to think of the world balancing moral progress with richness
sh well i think once you admit that we are on the path toward understanding our minds at the level of the brain in some important detail then you have to admit that we are going to understand all of the positive and negative qualities of ourselves in much greater detail
so we 're going to understand positive social emotion like empathy and compassion and we 're going to understand the factors that encourage it whether they 're genetic whether they 're how people talk to one another whether they 're economic systems and insofar as we begin to shine light on that we are inevitably going to converge on that fact space
so everything is not going to be up for grabs
it 's not going to be like veiling my daughter from birth is just as good as teaching her to be confident and well-educated in the context of men who do desire women
i mean i don 't think we need an nsf grant to know that compulsory veiling is a bad idea but at a certain point we 're going to be able to scan the brains of everyone involved and actually interrogate them
do people love their daughters just as much in these systems
and i think there are clearly right answers to that
and if the results come out that actually they do are you prepared to shift your instinctive current judgment on some of these issues
sh well yeah modulo one obvious fact that you can love someone in the context of a truly delusional belief system
so you can say like because i knew my gay son was going to go to hell if he found a boyfriend i chopped his head off and that was the most compassionate thing i could do
if you get all those parts aligned yes i think you could probably be feeling the emotion of love
but again then we have to talk about well-being in a larger context
it 's all of us in this together not one man feeling ecstasy and then blowing himself up on a bus
sam this is a conversation i would actually love to continue for hours
we don 't have that but maybe another time thank you for coming to ted
sh really an honor thank you
salaam namaskar
good morning
given my ted profile you might be expecting that i 'm going to speak to you about the latest philanthropic trends the one that 's currently got wall street and the world bank buzzing how to invest in women how to empower them how to save them
not me
i am interested in how women are saving us
they 're saving us by redefining and re-imagining a future that defies and blurs accepted polarities polarities we 've taken for granted for a long time like the ones between modernity and tradition first world and third world oppression and opportunity
in the midst of the daunting challenges we face as a global community there 's something about this third way raga that is making my heart sing
what intrigues me most is how women are doing this despite a set of paradoxes that are both frustrating and fascinating
why is it that women are on the one hand viciously oppressed by cultural practices and yet at the same time are the preservers of cultures in most societies
is the hijab or the headscarf a symbol of submission or resistance
when so many women and girls are beaten raped maimed on a daily basis in the name of all kinds of causes honor religion nationality what allows women to replant trees to rebuild societies to lead radical non-violent movements for social change
is it different women who are doing the preserving and the radicalizing
or are they one and the same
are we guilty as chimamanda adichie reminded us at the ted conference in oxford of assuming that there is a single story of women 's struggles for their rights while there are in fact many
and what if anything do men have to do with it
much of my life has been a quest to get some answers to these questions
it 's taken me across the globe and introduced me to some amazing people
in the process i 've gathered a few fragments that help me shed some light on this puzzle
among those who 've helped open my eyes to a third way are a devout muslim in afghanistan a group of harmonizing lesbians in croatia and a taboo breaker in liberia
i 'm indebted to them as i am to my parents who for some set of misdemeanors in their last life were blessed with three daughters in this one
and for reasons equally unclear to me seem to be inordinately proud of the three of us
i was born and raised here in india and i learned from an early age to be deeply suspicious of the aunties and uncles who would bend down pat us on the head and then say to my parents with no problem at all poor things you only have three daughters
but you 're young you could still try again
my sense of outrage about women 's rights was brought to a boil when i was about 11
my aunt an incredibly articulate and brilliant woman was widowed early
a flock of relatives descended on her
they took off her colorful sari
they made her wear a white one
they wiped her bindi off her forehead
they broke her bangles
her daughter rani a few years older than me sat in her lap bewildered not knowing what had happened to the confident woman she once knew as her mother
late that night i heard my mother begging my father please do something ramu can 't you intervene
and my father in a low voice muttering i 'm just the youngest brother there 's nothing i can do
this is tradition
that 's the night i learned the rules about what it means to be female in this world
women don 't make those rules but they define us and they define our opportunities and our chances
and men are affected by those rules too
my father who had fought in three wars could not save his own sister from this suffering
by 18 under the excellent tutelage of my mother i was therefore as you might expect defiantly feminist
on the streets chanting [ hindi ] [ hindi ] we are the women of india
we are not flowers we are sparks of change
by the time i got to beijing in 1995 it was clear to me the only way to achieve gender equality was to overturn centuries of oppressive tradition
soon after i returned from beijing i leapt at the chance to work for this wonderful organization founded by women to support women 's rights organizations around the globe
but barely six months into my new job i met a woman who forced me to challenge all my assumptions
her name is sakena yacoobi
she walked into my office at a time when no one knew where afghanistan was in the united states
she said to me it is not about the burka
she was the most determined advocate for women 's rights i had ever heard
she told me women were running underground schools in her communities inside afghanistan and that her organization the afghan institute of learning had started a school in pakistan
she said the first thing anyone who is a muslim knows is that the koran requires and strongly supports literacy
the prophet wanted every believer to be able to read the koran for themselves
had i heard right
was a women 's rights advocate invoking religion
but sakena defies labels
she always wears a headscarf but i 've walked alongside with her on a beach with her long hair flying in the breeze
she starts every lecture with a prayer but she 's a single feisty financially independent woman in a country where girls are married off at the age of 12
she is also immensely pragmatic
this headscarf and these clothes she says give me the freedom to do what i need to do to speak to those whose support and assistance are critical for this work
when i had to open the school in the refugee camp i went to see the imam
i told him i 'm a believer and women and children in these terrible conditions need their faith to survive she smiles slyly
he was flattered
he began to come twice a week to my center because women could not go to the mosque
and after he would leave women and girls would stay behind
we began with a small literacy class to read the koran then a math class then an english class then computer classes
in a few weeks everyone in the refugee camp was in our classes
sakena is a teacher at a time when to educate women is a dangerous business in afghanistan
she is on the taliban 's hit list
i worry about her every time she travels across that country
she shrugs when i ask her about safety
kavita jaan we cannot allow ourselves to be afraid
look at those young girls who go back to school when acid is thrown in their face
and i smile and i nod realizing i 'm watching women and girls using their own religious traditions and practices turning them into instruments of opposition and opportunity
their path is their own and it looks towards an afghanistan that will be different
being different is something the women of lesbor in zagreb croatia know all too well
to be a lesbian a dyke a homosexual in most parts of the world including right here in our country india is to occupy a place of immense discomfort and extreme prejudice
in post-conflict societies like croatia where a hyper-nationalism and religiosity have created an environment unbearable for anyone who might be considered a social outcast
so enter a group of out dykes young women who love the old music that once spread across that region from macedonia to bosnia from serbia to slovenia
these folk singers met at college at a gender studies program
many are in their 20s some are mothers
many have struggled to come out to their communities in families whose religious beliefs make it hard to accept that their daughters are not sick just queer
as leah one of the founders of the group says i like traditional music very much
i also like rock and roll
so lesbor we blend the two
i see traditional music like a kind of rebellion in which people can really speak their voice especially traditional songs from other parts of the former yugoslav republic
after the war lots of these songs were lost but they are a part of our childhood and our history and we should not forget them
improbably this lgbt singing choir has demonstrated how women are investing in tradition to create change like alchemists turning discord into harmony
their repertoire includes the croatian national anthem a bosnian love song and serbian duets
and leah adds with a grin kavita we especially are proud of our christmas music because it shows we are open to religious practices even though catholic church hates us lgbt
their concerts draw from their own communities yes but also from an older generation a generation that might be suspicious of homosexuality but is nostalgic for its own music and the past it represents
one father who had initially balked at his daughter coming out in such a choir now writes songs for them
in the middle ages troubadours would travel across the land singing their tales and sharing their verses lesbor travels through the balkans like this singing connecting people divided by religion nationality and language
bosnians croats and serbs find a rare shared space of pride in their history and lesbor reminds them that the songs one group often claims as theirs alone really belong to them all
yesterday mallika sarabhai showed us that music can create a world more accepting of difference than the one we have been given
the world layma bowie was given was a world at war
liberia had been torn apart by civil strife for decades
layma was not an activist she was a mother of three
but she was sick with worry she worried her son would be abducted and taken off to be a child soldier she worried her daughters would be raped she worried for their lives
one night she had a dream
she dreamt she and thousands of other women ended the bloodshed
the next morning at church she asked others how they felt
they were all tired of the fighting
we need peace and we need our leaders to know we will not rest until there is peace
among layma 's friends was a policewoman who was muslim
she promised to raise the issue with her community
at the next friday sermon the women who were sitting in the side room of the mosque began to share their distress at the state of affairs
what does it matter they said a bullet doesn 't distinguish between a muslim and a christian
this small group of women determined to bring an end to the war and they chose to use their traditions to make a point liberian women usually wear lots of jewelry and colorful clothing
but no for the protest they dressed all in white no makeup
as layma said we wore the white saying we were out for peace
they stood on the side of the road on which charles taylor 's motorcade passed every day
they stood for weeks first just 10 then 20 then 50 then hundreds of women wearing white singing dancing saying they were out for peace
eventually opposing forces in liberia were pushed to hold peace talks in ghana
the peace talks dragged on and on and on
layma and her sisters had had enough
with their remaining funds they took a small group of women down to the venue of the peace talks and they surrounded the building
in a now famous cnn clip you can see them sitting on the ground their arms linked
we know this in india it 's called a [ hindi ]
then things get tense
the police are called in to physically remove the women
as the senior officer approaches with a baton layma stands up with deliberation reaches her arms up over her head and begins very slowly to untie her headdress that covers her hair
you can see the policeman 's face
he looks embarrassed he backs away
and the next thing you know the police have disappeared
layma said to me later it 's a taboo you know in west africa
if an older woman undresses in front of a man because she wants to the man 's family is cursed
she said i don 't know if he did it because he believed but he knew we were not going to leave
we were not going to leave until the peace accord was signed
and the peace accord was signed
and the women of liberia then mobilized in support of ellen johnson sirleaf a woman who broke a few taboos herself becoming the first elected woman head of state in africa in years
when she made her presidential address she acknowledged these brave women of liberia who allowed her to win against a football star that 's soccer for you americans no less
women like sakena and leah and layma have humbled me and changed me and made me realize that i should not be so quick to jump to assumptions of any kind
they 've also saved me from my righteous anger by offering insights into this third way
a filipina activist once said to me how do you cook a rice cake
with heat from the bottom and heat from the top
the protests the marches the uncompromising position that women 's rights are human rights full stop
that 's the heat from the bottom
that 's malcolm x and the suffragists and gay pride parades
but we also need the heat from the top
and in most parts of the world that top is still controlled by men
so to paraphrase marx women make change but not in circumstances of their own choosing
they have to negotiate
they have to subvert tradition that once silenced them in order to give voice to new aspirations
and they need allies from their communities
allies like the imam allies like the father who now writes songs for a lesbian group in croatia allies like the policeman who honored a taboo and backed away allies like my father who couldn 't help his sister but has helped three daughters pursue their dreams
maybe this is because feminism unlike almost every other social movement is not a struggle against a distinct oppressor it 's not the ruling class or the occupiers or the colonizers it 's against a deeply held set of beliefs and assumptions that we women far too often hold ourselves
and perhaps this is the ultimate gift of feminism that the personal is in fact the political
so that as eleanor roosevelt said once of human rights the same is true of gender equality that it starts in small places close to home
on the streets yes but also in negotiations at the kitchen table and in the marital bed and in relationships between lovers and parents and sisters and friends
and then you realize that by integrating aspects of tradition and community into their struggles women like sakena and leah and layma but also women like sonia gandhi here in india and michelle bachelet in chile and shirin ebadi in iran are doing something else
they 're challenging the very notion of western models of development
they are saying we don 't have to be like you to make change
we can wear a sari or a hijab or pants or a boubou and we can be party leaders and presidents and human rights lawyers
we can use our tradition to navigate change
we can demilitarize societies and pour resources instead into reservoirs of genuine security
it is in these little stories these individual stories that i see a radical epic being written by women around the world
it is in these threads that are being woven into a resilient fabric that will sustain communities that i find hope
and if my heart is singing it 's because in these little fragments every now and again you catch a glimpse of a whole of a whole new world
and she is definitely on her way
thank you
so it 's 1995 i 'm in college and a friend and i go on a road trip from providence rhode island to portland oregon
and you know we 're young and unemployed so we do the whole thing on back roads through state parks and national forests basically the longest route we can possibly take
and somewhere in the middle of south dakota i turn to my friend and i ask her a question that 's been bothering me for 2,000 miles
what 's up with the chinese character i keep seeing by the side of the road
my friend looks at me totally blankly
there 's actually a gentleman in the front row who 's doing a perfect imitation of her look
and i 'm like you know all the signs we keep seeing with the chinese character on them
she just stares at me for a few moments and then she cracks up because she figures out what i 'm talking about
and what i 'm talking about is this
right the famous chinese character for picnic area
i 've spent the last five years of my life thinking about situations exactly like this why we sometimes misunderstand the signs around us and how we behave when that happens and what all of this can tell us about human nature
in other words as you heard chris say i 've spent the last five years thinking about being wrong
this might strike you as a strange career move but it actually has one great advantage no job competition
in fact most of us do everything we can to avoid thinking about being wrong or at least to avoid thinking about the possibility that we ourselves are wrong
we get it in the abstract
we all know everybody in this room makes mistakes
the human species in general is fallible okay fine
but when it comes down to me right now to all the beliefs i hold here in the present tense suddenly all of this abstract appreciation of fallibility goes out the window and i can 't actually think of anything i 'm wrong about
and the thing is the present tense is where we live
we go to meetings in the present tense we go on family vacations in the present tense we go to the polls and vote in the present tense
so effectively we all kind of wind up traveling through life trapped in this little bubble of feeling very right about everything
i think this is a problem
i think it 's a problem for each of us as individuals in our personal and professional lives and i think it 's a problem for all of us collectively as a culture
so what i want to do today is first of all talk about why we get stuck inside this feeling of being right
and second why it 's such a problem
and finally i want to convince you that it is possible to step outside of that feeling and that if you can do so it is the single greatest moral intellectual and creative leap you can make
so why do we get stuck in this feeling of being right
one reason actually has to do with a feeling of being wrong
so let me ask you guys something or actually let me ask you guys something because you 're right here how does it feel emotionally how does it feel to be wrong
dreadful thumbs down
embarrassing okay wonderful great
dreadful thumbs down embarrassing thank you these are great answers but they 're answers to a different question
you guys are answering the question how does it feel to realize you 're wrong
realizing you 're wrong can feel like all of that and a lot of other things right
i mean it can be devastating it can be revelatory it can actually be quite funny like my stupid chinese character mistake
but just being wrong doesn 't feel like anything
i 'll give you an analogy
do you remember that loony tunes cartoon where there 's this pathetic coyote who 's always chasing and never catching a roadrunner
in pretty much every episode of this cartoon there 's a moment where the coyote is chasing the roadrunner and the roadrunner runs off a cliff which is fine he 's a bird he can fly
but the thing is the coyote runs off the cliff right after him
and what 's funny at least if you 're six years old is that the coyote 's totally fine too
he just keeps running right up until the moment that he looks down and realizes that he 's in mid-air
that 's when he falls
when we 're wrong about something not when we realize it but before that we 're like that coyote after he 's gone off the cliff and before he looks down
you know we 're already wrong we 're already in trouble but we feel like we 're on solid ground
so i should actually correct something i said a moment ago
it does feel like something to be wrong it feels like being right
so this is one reason a structural reason why we get stuck inside this feeling of rightness
i call this error blindness
most of the time we don 't have any kind of internal cue to let us know that we 're wrong about something until it 's too late
but there 's a second reason that we get stuck inside this feeling as well and this one is cultural
think back for a moment to elementary school
you 're sitting there in class and your teacher is handing back quiz papers and one of them looks like this
this is not mine by the way
so there you are in grade school and you know exactly what to think about the kid who got this paper
it 's the dumb kid the troublemaker the one who never does his homework
so by the time you are nine years old you 've already learned first of all that people who get stuff wrong are lazy irresponsible dimwits and second of all that the way to succeed in life is to never make any mistakes
we learn these really bad lessons really well
and a lot of us and i suspect especially a lot of us in this room deal with them by just becoming perfect little a students perfectionists over-achievers
right mr. cfo astrophysicist ultra-marathoner
you 're all cfo astrophysicists ultra-marathoners it turns out
okay so fine
except that then we freak out at the possibility that we 've gotten something wrong
because according to this getting something wrong means there 's something wrong with us
so we just insist that we 're right because it makes us feel smart and responsible and virtuous and safe
so let me tell you a story
a couple of years ago a woman comes into beth israel deaconess medical center for a surgery
beth israel 's in boston
it 's the teaching hospital for harvard one of the best hospitals in the country
so this woman comes in and she 's taken into the operating room
she 's anesthetized the surgeon does his thing stitches her back up sends her out to the recovery room
everything seems to have gone fine
and she wakes up and she looks down at herself and she says why is the wrong side of my body in bandages
well the wrong side of her body is in bandages because the surgeon has performed a major operation on her left leg instead of her right one
when the vice president for health care quality at beth israel spoke about this incident he said something very interesting
he said for whatever reason the surgeon simply felt that he was on the correct side of the patient
the point of this story is that trusting too much in the feeling of being on the correct side of anything can be very dangerous
this internal sense of rightness that we all experience so often is not a reliable guide to what is actually going on in the external world
and when we act like it is and we stop entertaining the possibility that we could be wrong well that 's when we end up doing things like dumping 200 million gallons of oil into the gulf of mexico or torpedoing the global economy
so this is a huge practical problem
but it 's also a huge social problem
think for a moment about what it means to feel right
it means that you think that your beliefs just perfectly reflect reality
and when you feel that way you 've got a problem to solve which is how are you going to explain all of those people who disagree with you
it turns out most of us explain those people the same way by resorting to a series of unfortunate assumptions
the first thing we usually do when someone disagrees with us is we just assume they 're ignorant
they don 't have access to the same information that we do and when we generously share that information with them they 're going to see the light and come on over to our team
when that doesn 't work when it turns out those people have all the same facts that we do and they still disagree with us then we move on to a second assumption which is that they 're idiots
they have all the right pieces of the puzzle and they are too moronic to put them together correctly
and when that doesn 't work when it turns out that people who disagree with us have all the same facts we do and are actually pretty smart then we move on to a third assumption they know the truth and they are deliberately distorting it for their own malevolent purposes
so this is a catastrophe
this attachment to our own rightness keeps us from preventing mistakes when we absolutely need to and causes us to treat each other terribly
but to me what 's most baffling and most tragic about this is that it misses the whole point of being human
it 's like we want to imagine that our minds are just these perfectly translucent windows and we just gaze out of them and describe the world as it unfolds
and we want everybody else to gaze out of the same window and see the exact same thing
that is not true and if it were life would be incredibly boring
the miracle of your mind isn 't that you can see the world as it is
it 's that you can see the world as it isn 't
we can remember the past and we can think about the future and we can imagine what it 's like to be some other person in some other place
and we all do this a little differently which is why we can all look up at the same night sky and see this and also this and also this
and yeah it is also why we get things wrong
1,200 years before descartes said his famous thing about i think therefore i am this guy st. augustine sat down and wrote fallor ergo sum i err therefore i am
augustine understood that our capacity to screw up it 's not some kind of embarrassing defect in the human system something we can eradicate or overcome
it 's totally fundamental to who we are
because unlike god we don 't really know what 's going on out there
and unlike all of the other animals we are obsessed with trying to figure it out
to me this obsession is the source and root of all of our productivity and creativity
last year for various reasons i found myself listening to a lot of episodes of the public radio show this american life
and so i 'm listening and i 'm listening and at some point i start feeling like all the stories are about being wrong
and my first thought was i 've lost it
i 've become the crazy wrongness lady
i just imagined it everywhere which has happened
but a couple of months later i actually had a chance to interview ira glass who 's the host of the show
and i mentioned this to him and he was like no actually that 's true
in fact he says as a staff we joke that every single episode of our show has the same crypto-theme
and the crypto-theme is i thought this one thing was going to happen and something else happened instead and the thing is says ira glass we need this
we need these moments of surprise and reversal and wrongness to make these stories work
and for the rest of us audience members as listeners as readers we eat this stuff up
we love things like plot twists and red herrings and surprise endings
when it comes to our stories we love being wrong
but you know our stories are like this because our lives are like this
we think this one thing is going to happen and something else happens instead
george bush thought he was going to invade iraq find a bunch of weapons of mass destruction liberate the people and bring democracy to the middle east
and something else happened instead
and hosni mubarak thought he was going to be the dictator of egypt for the rest of his life until he got too old or too sick and could pass the reigns of power onto his son
and something else happened instead
and maybe you thought you were going to grow up and marry your high school sweetheart and move back to your hometown and raise a bunch of kids together
and something else happened instead
and i have to tell you that i thought i was writing an incredibly nerdy book about a subject everybody hates for an audience that would never materialize
and something else happened instead
i mean this is life
for good and for ill we generate these incredible stories about the world around us and then the world turns around and astonishes us
no offense but this entire conference is an unbelievable monument to our capacity to get stuff wrong
we just spent an entire week talking about innovations and advancements and improvements but you know why we need all of those innovations and advancements and improvements
because half the stuff that 's the most mind-boggling and world-altering ted 1998 eh
didn 't really work out that way did it
where 's my jet pack chris
so here we are again
and that 's how it goes
we come up with another idea
we tell another story
we hold another conference
the theme of this one as you guys have now heard seven million times is the rediscovery of wonder
and to me if you really want to rediscover wonder you need to step outside of that tiny terrified space of rightness and look around at each other and look out at the vastness and complexity and mystery of the universe and be able to say wow i don 't know
maybe i 'm wrong
thank you
thank you guys
many times i go around the world to speak and people ask me questions about the challenges my moments some of my regrets
1998 a single mother of four three months after the birth of my fourth child i went to do a job as a research assistant
i went to northern liberia
and as part of the work the village would give you lodgings
and they gave me lodging with a single mother and her daughter
this girl happened to be the only girl in the entire village who had made it to the ninth grade
she was the laughing stock of the community
her mother was often told by other women you and your child will die poor
after two weeks of working in that village it was time to go back
the mother came to me knelt down and said leymah take my daughter
i wish for her to be a nurse
dirt poor living in the home with my parents i couldn 't afford to
with tears in my eyes i said no
two months later i go to another village on the same assignment and they asked me to live with the village chief
the women 's chief of the village has this little girl fair color like me totally dirty
and all day she walked around only in her underwear
when i asked who is that
she said that 's wei
the meaning of her name is pig
her mother died while giving birth to her and no one had any idea who her father was
for two weeks she became my companion slept with me
i bought her used clothes and bought her her first doll
the night before i left she came to the room and said leymah don 't leave me here
i wish to go with you
i wish to go to school
dirt poor no money living with my parents i again said no
two months later both of those villages fell into another war
till today i have no idea where those two girls are
fast-forward 2004 in the peak of our activism the minister of gender liberia called me and said leymah i have a nine-year-old for you
i want you to bring her home because we don 't have safe homes
the story of this little girl she had been raped by her paternal grandfather every day for six months
she came to me bloated very pale
every night i 'd come from work and lie on the cold floor
she 'd lie beside me and say auntie i wish to be well
i wish to go to school
2010 a young woman stands before president sirleaf and gives her testimony of how she and her siblings live together their father and mother died during the war
she 's 19 her dream is to go to college to be able to support them
she 's highly athletic
one of the things that happens is that she applies for a scholarship
full scholarship she gets it
her dream of going to school her wish of being educated is finally here
she goes to school on the first day
the director of sports who 's responsible for getting her into the program asks her to come out of class
and for the next three years her fate will be having sex with him every day as a favor for getting her in school
globally we have policies international instruments work leaders
great people have made commitments we will protect our children from want and from fear
the u.n. has the convention on the rights of the child
countries like america we 've heard things like no child left behind
other countries come with different things
there is a millennium development called three that focuses on girls
all of these great works by great people aimed at getting young people to where we want to get them globally i think has failed
in liberia for example the teenage pregnancy rate is three to every 10 girls
teen prostitution is at its peak
in one community we 're told you wake up in the morning and see used condoms like used chewing gum paper
girls as young as 12 being prostituted for less than a dollar a night
it 's disheartening it 's sad
and then someone asked me just before my tedtalk a few days ago so where is the hope
several years ago a few friends of mine decided we needed to bridge the disconnect between our generation and the generation of young women
it 's not enough to say you have two nobel laureates from the republic of liberia when your girls kids are totally out there and no hope or seemingly no hope
we created a space called the young girls transformative project
we go into rural communities and all we do like has been done in this room is create the space
when these girls sit you unlock intelligence you unlock passion you unlock commitment you unlock focus you unlock great leaders
today we 've worked with over 300
and some of those girls who walked in the room very shy have taken bold steps as young mothers to go out there and advocate for the rights of other young women
one young woman i met teen mother of four never thought about finishing high school graduated successfully never thought about going to college enrolled in college
one day she said to me my wish is to finish college and be able to support my children
she 's at a place where she can 't find money to go to school
she sells water sells soft drinks and sells recharge cards for cellphones
and you would think she would take that money and put it back into her education
juanita is her name
she takes that money and finds single mothers in her community to send back to school
says leymah my wish is to be educated
and if i can 't be educated when i see some of my sisters being educated my wish has been fulfilled
i wish for a better life
i wish for food for my children
i wish that sexual abuse and exploitation in schools would stop
this is the dream of the african girl
several years ago there was one african girl
this girl had a son who wished for a piece of doughnut because he was extremely hungry
angry frustrated really upset about the state of her society and the state of her children this young girl started a movement a movement of ordinary women banding together to build peace
i will fulfill the wish
this is another african girl 's wish
i failed to fulfill the wish of those two girls
i failed to do this
these were the things that were going through the head of this other young woman i failed i failed i failed
so i will do this
women came out protested a brutal dictator fearlessly spoke
not only did the wish of a piece of doughnut come true the wish of peace came true
this young woman wished also to go to school
she went to school
this young woman wished for other things to happen it happened for her
today this young woman is me a nobel laureate
i 'm now on a journey to fulfill the wish in my tiny capacity of little african girls the wish of being educated
we set up a foundation
we 're giving full four-year scholarships to girls from villages that we see with potential
i don 't have much to ask of you
i 've also been to places in this u.s. and i know that girls in this country also have wishes a wish for a better life somewhere in the bronx a wish for a better life somewhere in downtown l.a. a wish for a better life somewhere in texas a wish for a better life somewhere in new york a wish for a better life somewhere in new jersey
will you journey with me to help that girl be it an african girl or an american girl or a japanese girl fulfill her wish fulfill her dream achieve that dream
because all of these great innovators and inventors that we 've talked to and seen over the last few days are also sitting in tiny corners in different parts of the world and all they 're asking us to do is create that space to unlock the intelligence unlock the passion unlock all of the great things that they hold within themselves
let 's journey together let 's journey together
thank you
thank you so much
right now in liberia what do you see as the main issue that troubles you
lg i 've been asked to lead the liberian reconciliation initiative
as part of my work i 'm doing these tours in different villages and towns 13 15 hours on dirt roads and there is no community that i 've gone into that i haven 't seen intelligent girls
but sadly the vision of a great future or the dream of a great future is just a dream because you have all of these vices
teen pregnancy like i said is epidemic
so what troubles me is that i was at that place and somehow i 'm at this place and i just don 't want to be the only one at this place
i 'm looking for ways for other girls to be with me
i want to look back 20 years from now and see that there 's another liberian girl ghanaian girl nigerian girl ethiopian girl standing on this ted stage
and maybe just maybe saying because of that nobel laureate i 'm here today
so i 'm troubled when i see them like there 's no hope
but i 'm also not pessimistic because i know it doesn 't take a lot to get them charged up
and in the last year tell us one hopeful thing that you 've seen happening
lg i can tell you many hopeful things that i 've seen happening
but in the last year where president sirleaf comes from her village we went there to work with these girls
and we could not find 25 girls in high school
all of these girls went to the gold mine and they were predominantly prostitutes doing other things
we took 50 of those girls and we worked with them
and this was at the beginning of elections
this is one place where women were never even the older ones barely sat in the circle with the men
these girls banded together and formed a group and launched a campaign for voter registration
this is a real rural village
and the theme they used was even pretty girls vote
they were able to mobilize young women
but not only did they do that they went to those who were running for seats to ask them what is it that you will give the girls of this community when you win
and one of the guys who already had a seat was very because liberia has one of the strongest rape laws and he was one of those really fighting in parliament to overturn that law because he called it barbaric
rape is not barbaric but the law he said was barbaric
and when the girls started engaging him he was very hostile towards them
these little girls turned to him and said we will vote you out of office
he 's out of office today
leymah thank you thank you so much for coming to ted
lg you 're welcome
hi so i 'd like to talk a little bit about the people who make the things we use every day our shoes our handbags our computers and cell phones
now this is a conversation that often calls up a lot of guilt
imagine the teenage farm girl who makes less than a dollar an hour stitching your running shoes or the young chinese man who jumps off a rooftop after working overtime assembling your ipad
we the beneficiaries of globalization seem to exploit these victims with every purchase we make and the injustice feels embedded in the products themselves
after all what 's wrong with a world in which a worker on an iphone assembly line can 't even afford to buy one
it 's taken for granted that chinese factories are oppressive and that it 's our desire for cheap goods that makes them so
so this simple narrative equating western demand and chinese suffering is appealing especially at a time when many of us already feel guilty about our impact on the world but it 's also inaccurate and disrespectful
we must be peculiarly self-obsessed to imagine that we have the power to drive tens of millions of people on the other side of the world to migrate and suffer in such terrible ways
in fact china makes goods for markets all over the world including its own thanks to a combination of factors its low costs its large and educated workforce and a flexible manufacturing system that responds quickly to market demands
by focusing so much on ourselves and our gadgets we have rendered the individuals on the other end into invisibility as tiny and interchangeable as the parts of a mobile phone
chinese workers are not forced into factories because of our insatiable desire for ipods
they choose to leave their homes in order to earn money to learn new skills and to see the world
in the ongoing debate about globalization what 's been missing is the voices of the workers themselves
here are a few
bao yongxiu my mother tells me to come home and get married but if i marry now before i have fully developed myself i can only marry an ordinary worker so i 'm not in a rush
chen ying when i went home for the new year everyone said i had changed they asked me what did you do that you have changed so much
i told them that i studied and worked hard if you tell them more they won 't understand anyway
wu chunming even if i make a lot of money it won 't satisfy me
just to make money is not enough meaning in life
xiao jin now after i get off work i study english because in the future our customers won 't be only chinese so we must learn more languages
all of these speakers by the way are young women 18 or 19 years old
so i spent two years getting to know assembly line workers like these in the south china factory city called dongguan
certain subjects came up over and over how much money they made what kind of husband they hoped to marry whether they should jump to another factory or stay where they were
other subjects came up almost never including living conditions that to me looked close to prison life 10 or 15 workers in one room 50 people sharing a single bathroom days and nights ruled by the factory clock
everyone they knew lived in similar circumstances and it was still better than the dormitories and homes of rural china
the workers rarely spoke about the products they made and they often had great difficulty explaining what exactly they did
when i asked lu qingmin the young woman i got to know best what exactly she did on the factory floor she said something to me in chinese that sounded like qiu xi
only much later did i realize that she had been saying qc or quality control
she couldn 't even tell me what she did on the factory floor
all she could do was parrot a garbled abbreviation in a language she didn 't even understand
karl marx saw this as the tragedy of capitalism the alienation of the worker from the product of his labor
unlike say a traditional maker of shoes or cabinets the worker in an industrial factory has no control no pleasure and no true satisfaction or understanding in her own work
but like so many theories that marx arrived at sitting in the reading room of the british museum he got this one wrong
just because a person spends her time making a piece of something does not mean that she becomes that a piece of something
what she does with the money she earns what she learns in that place and how it changes her these are the things that matter
what a factory makes is never the point and the workers could not care less who buys their products
journalistic coverage of chinese factories on the other hand plays up this relationship between the workers and the products they make
many articles calculate how long would it take for this worker to work in order to earn enough money to buy what he 's making
for example an entry-level-line assembly line worker in china in an iphone plant would have to shell out two and a half months wages for an iphone
but how meaningful is this calculation really
for example i recently wrote an article in the new yorker magazine but i can 't afford to buy an ad in it
but who cares i don 't want an ad in the new yorker and most of these workers don 't really want iphones
their calculations are different
how long should i stay in this factory
how much money can i save
how much will it take to buy an apartment or a car to get married or to put my child through school
the workers i got to know had a curiously abstract relationship with the product of their labor
about a year after i met lu qingmin or min she invited me home to her family village for the chinese new year
on the train home she gave me a present a coach brand change purse with brown leather trim
i thanked her assuming it was fake like almost everything else for sale in dongguan
after we got home min gave her mother another present a pink dooney & amp bourke handbag and a few nights later her sister was showing off a maroon lesportsac shoulder bag
slowly it was dawning on me that these handbags were made by their factory and every single one of them was authentic
min 's sister said to her parents in america this bag sells for 320 dollars
her parents who are both farmers looked on speechless
and that 's not all coach is coming out with a new line 2191 she said one bag will sell for 6,000
she paused and said i don 't know if that 's 6,000 yuan or 6,000 american dollars but anyway it 's 6,000
min 's sister 's boyfriend who had traveled home with her for the new year said it doesn 't look like it 's worth that much
min 's sister turned to him and said some people actually understand these things you don 't understand shit
in min 's world the coach bags had a curious currency
they weren 't exactly worthless but they were nothing close to the actual value because almost no one they knew wanted to buy one or knew how much it was worth
once when min 's older sister 's friend got married she brought a handbag along as a wedding present
another time after min had already left the handbag factory her younger sister came to visit bringing two coach signature handbags as gifts
i looked in the zippered pocket of one and i found a printed card in english which read an american classic
in 1941 the burnished patina of an all-american baseball glove inspired the founder of coach to create a new collection of handbags from the same luxuriously soft gloved-hand leather
six skilled leatherworkers crafted 12 signature handbags with perfect proportions and a timeless flair
they were fresh functional and women everywhere adored them a new american classic was born
i wonder what karl marx would have made of min and her sisters
their relationship with the product of their labor was more complicated surprising and funny than he could have imagined
and yet his view of the world persists and our tendency to see the workers as faceless masses to imagine that we can know what they 're really thinking
the first time i met min she had just turned 18 and quit her first job on the assembly line of an electronics factory
over the next two years i watched as she switched jobs five times eventually landing a lucrative post in the purchasing department of a hardware factory
later she married a fellow migrant worker moved with him to his village gave birth to two daughters and saved enough money to buy a secondhand buick for herself and an apartment for her parents
she recently returned to dongguan on her own to take a job in a factory that makes construction cranes temporarily leaving her husband and children back in the village
in a recent email to me she explained a person should have some ambition while she is young so that in old age she can look back on her life and feel that it was not lived to no purpose
across china there are 150 million workers like her one third of them women who have left their villages to work in the factories the hotels the restaurants and the construction sites of the big cities
together they make up the largest migration in history and it is globalization this chain that begins in a chinese farming village and ends with iphones in our pockets and nikes on our feet and coach handbags on our arms that has changed the way these millions of people work and marry and live and think
very few of them would want to go back to the way things used to be
when i first went to dongguan i worried that it would be depressing to spend so much time with workers
i also worried that nothing would ever happen to them or that they would have nothing to say to me
instead i found young women who were smart and funny and brave and generous
by opening up their lives to me they taught me so much about factories and about china and about how to live in the world
this is the coach purse that min gave me on the train home to visit her family
i keep it with me to remind me of the ties that tie me to the young women i wrote about ties that are not economic but personal in nature measured not in money but in memories
this purse is also a reminder that the things that you imagine sitting in your office or in the library are not how you find them when you actually go out into the world
thank you
thank you leslie that was an insight that a lot of us haven 't had before
but i 'm curious if you had a minute say with apple 's head of manufacturing what would you say
leslie chang one minute
one minute
lc you know what really impressed me about the workers is how much they 're self-motivated self-driven resourceful and the thing that struck me what they want most is education to learn because most of them come from very poor backgrounds
they usually left school when they were in 7th or 8th grade
their parents are often illiterate and then they come to the city and they on their own at night during the weekends they 'll take a computer class they 'll take an english class and learn really really rudimentary things you know like how to type a document in word or how to say really simple things in english
so if you really want to help these workers start these small very focused very pragmatic classes in these schools and what 's going to happen is all your workers are going to move on but hopefully they 'll move on into higher jobs within apple and you can help their social mobility and their self-improvement
when you talk to workers that 's what they want
they do not say i want better hot water in the showers
i want a nicer room i want a tv set
i mean it would be nice to have those things but that 's not why they 're in the city and that 's not what they care about
was there a sense from them of a narrative that things were kind of tough and bad or was there a narrative of some kind of level of growth that things over time were getting better
lc oh definitely definitely i mean you know it was interesting because i spent basically two years hanging out in this city dongguan and over that time you could see immense change in every person 's life upward downward sideways but generally upward
if you spend enough time it 's upward and i met people who had moved to the city 10 years ago and who are now basically urban middle class people so the trajectory is definitely upward
it 's just hard to see when you 're suddenly sucked into the city it looks like everyone 's poor and desperate but that 's not really how it is
certainly the factory conditions are really tough and it 's nothing you or i would want to do but from their perspective where they 're coming from is much worse and where they 're going is hopefully much better and i just wanted to give that context of what 's going on in their minds not what necessarily is going on in yours
thanks so much for your talk
thank you very much
the things we make have one supreme quality they live longer than us
we perish they survive we have one life they have many lives and in each life they can mean different things
which means that while we all have one biography they have many
i want this morning to talk about the story the biography or rather the biographies of one particular object one remarkable thing
it doesn 't i agree look very much
it 's about the size of a rugby ball
it 's made of clay and it 's been fashioned into a cylinder shape covered with close writing and then baked dry in the sun
and as you can see it 's been knocked about a bit which is not surprising because it was made two and a half thousand years ago and was dug up in 1879
but today this thing is i believe a major player in the politics of the middle east
and it 's an object with fascinating stories and stories that are by no means over yet
the story begins in the iran-iraq war and that series of events that culminated in the invasion of iraq by foreign forces the removal of a despotic ruler and instant regime change
and i want to begin with one episode from that sequence of events that most of you would be very familiar with belshazzar 's feast because we 're talking about the iran-iraq war of 539 bc
and the parallels between the events of 539 bc and 2003 and in between are startling
what you 're looking at is rembrandt 's painting now in the national gallery in london illustrating the text from the prophet daniel in the hebrew scriptures
and you all know roughly the story
belshazzar the son of nebuchadnezzar nebuchadnezzar who 'd conquered israel sacked jerusalem and captured the people and taken the jews back to babylon
not only the jews he 'd taken the temple vessels
he 'd ransacked desecrated the temple
and the great gold vessels of the temple in jerusalem had been taken to babylon
belshazzar his son decides to have a feast
and in order to make it even more exciting he added a bit of sacrilege to the rest of the fun and he brings out the temple vessels
he 's already at war with the iranians with the king of persia
and that night daniel tells us at the height of the festivities a hand appeared and wrote on the wall you are weighed in the balance and found wanting and your kingdom is handed over to the medes and the persians
and that very night cyrus king of the persians entered babylon and the whole regime of belshazzar fell
it is of course a great moment in the history of the jewish people
it 's a great story it 's story we all know
the writing on the wall is part of our everyday language
what happened next was remarkable and it 's where our cylinder enters the story
cyrus king of the persians has entered babylon without a fight the great empire of babylon which ran from central southern iraq to the mediterranean falls to cyrus
and cyrus makes a declaration
and that is what this cylinder is the declaration made by the ruler guided by god who had toppled the iraqi despot and was going to bring freedom to the people
in ringing babylonian it was written in babylonian he says i am cyrus king of all the universe the great king the powerful king king of babylon king of the four quarters of the world
they 're not shy of hyperbole as you can see
this is probably the first real press release by a victorious army that we 've got
and it 's written as we 'll see in due course by very skilled p.r. consultants
so the hyperbole is not actually surprising
and what is the great king the powerful king the king of the four quarters of the world going to do
he goes on to say that having conquered babylon he will at once let all the peoples that the babylonians nebuchadnezzar and belshazzar have captured and enslaved go free
he 'll let them return to their countries
and more important he will let them all recover the gods the statues the temple vessels that had been confiscated
all the peoples that the babylonians had repressed and removed will go home and they 'll take with them their gods
and they 'll be able to restore their altars and to worship their gods in their own way in their own place
this is the decree this object is the evidence for the fact that the jews after the exile in babylon the years they 'd spent sitting by the waters of babylon weeping when they remembered jerusalem those jews were allowed to go home
they were allowed to return to jerusalem and to rebuild the temple
it 's a central document in jewish history
and the book of chronicles the book of ezra in the hebrew scriptures reported in ringing terms
this is the jewish version of the same story
thus said cyrus king of persia all the kingdoms of the earth have the lord god of heaven given thee and he has charged me to build him a house in jerusalem
who is there among you of his people
the lord god be with him and let him go up go up aaleh
the central element still of the notion of return a central part of the life of judaism
as you all know that return from exile the second temple reshaped judaism
and that change that great historic moment was made possible by cyrus the king of persia reported for us in hebrew in scripture and in babylonian in clay
two great texts what about the politics
what was going on was the fundamental shift in middle eastern history
the empire of iran the medes and the persians united under cyrus became the first great world empire
cyrus begins in the 530s bc
and by the time of his son darius the whole of the eastern mediterranean is under persian control
this empire is in fact the middle east as we now know it and it 's what shapes the middle east as we now know it
it was the largest empire the world had known until then
much more important it was the first multicultural multifaith state on a huge scale
and it had to be run in a quite new way
it had to be run in different languages
the fact that this decree is in babylonian says one thing
and it had to recognize their different habits different peoples different religions different faiths
all of those are respected by cyrus
cyrus sets up a model of how you run a great multinational multifaith multicultural society
and the result of that was an empire that included the areas you see on the screen and which survived for 200 years of stability until it was shattered by alexander
it left a dream of the middle east as a unit and a unit where people of different faiths could live together
the greek invasions ended that
and of course alexander couldn 't sustain a government and it fragmented
but what cyrus represented remained absolutely central
the greek historian xenophon wrote his book cyropaedia promoting cyrus as the great ruler
and throughout european culture afterward cyrus remained the model
this is a 16th century image to show you how widespread his veneration actually was
and xenophon 's book on cyrus on how you ran a diverse society was one of the great textbooks that inspired the founding fathers of the american revolution
jefferson was a great admirer the ideals of cyrus obviously speaking to those 18th century ideals of how you create religious tolerance in a new state
meanwhile back in babylon things had not been going well
after alexander the other empires babylon declines falls into ruins and all the traces of the great babylonian empire are lost until 1879 when the cylinder is discovered by a british museum exhibition digging in babylon
and it enters now another story
it enters that great debate in the middle of the 19th century are the scriptures reliable can we trust them
we only knew about the return of the jews and the decree of cyrus from the hebrew scriptures
no other evidence
suddenly this appeared
and great excitement to a world where those who believed in the scriptures had had their faith in creation shaken by evolution by geology here was evidence that the scriptures were historically true
it 's a great 19th century moment
but and this of course is where it becomes complicated the facts were true hurrah for archeology but the interpretation was rather more complicated
because the cylinder account and the hebrew bible account differ in one key respect
the babylonian cylinder is written by the priests of the great god of bablyon marduk
and not surprisingly they tell you that all this was done by marduk
marduk we hold called cyrus by his name
marduk takes cyrus by the hand calls him to shepherd his people and gives him the rule of babylon
marduk tells cyrus that he will do these great generous things of setting the people free
and this is why we should all be grateful to and worship marduk
the hebrew writers in the old testament you will not be surprised to learn take a rather different view of this
for them of course it can 't possibly by marduk that made all this happen
it can only be jehovah
and so in isaiah we have the wonderful texts giving all the credit of this not to marduk but to the lord god of israel the lord god of israel who also called cyrus by name also takes cyrus by the hand and talks of him shepherding his people
it 's a remarkable example of two different priestly appropriations of the same event two different religious takeovers of a political fact
god we know is usually on the side of the big battalions
the question is which god was it
and the debate unsettles everybody in the 19th century to realize that the hebrew scriptures are part of a much wider world of religion
and it 's quite clear the cylinder is older than the text of isaiah and yet jehovah is speaking in words very similar to those used by marduk
and there 's a slight sense that isaiah knows this because he says this is god speaking of course i have called thee by thy name though thou hast not known me
i think it 's recognized that cyrus doesn 't realize that he 's acting under orders from jehovah
and equally he 'd have been surprised that he was acting under orders from marduk
because interestingly of course cyrus is a good iranian with a totally different set of gods who are not mentioned in any of these texts
that 's 1879
40 years on and we 're in 1917 and the cylinder enters a different world
this time the real politics of the contemporary world the year of the balfour declaration the year when the new imperial power in the middle east britain decides that it will declare a jewish national home it will allow the jews to return
and the response to this by the jewish population in eastern europe is rhapsodic
and across eastern europe jews display pictures of cyrus and of george v side by side the two great rulers who have allowed the return to jerusalem
and the cyrus cylinder comes back into public view and the text of this as a demonstration of why what is going to happen after the war is over in 1918 is part of a divine plan
you all know what happened
the state of israel is setup and 50 years later in the late 60s it 's clear that britain 's role as the imperial power is over
and another story of the cylinder begins
the region the u.k. and the u.s. decide has to be kept safe from communism and the superpower that will be created to do this would be iran the shah
and so the shah invents an iranian history or a return to iranian history that puts him in the center of a great tradition and produces coins showing himself with the cyrus cylinder
when he has his great celebrations in persepolis he summons the cylinder and the cylinder is lent by the british museum goes to tehran and is part of those great celebrations of the pahlavi dynasty
cyrus cylinder guarantor of the shah
10 years later another story iranian revolution 1979
islamic revolution no more cyrus we 're not interested in that history we 're interested in islamic iran until iraq the new superpower that we 've all decided should be in the region attacks
then another iran-iraq war
and it becomes critical for the iranians to remember their great past their great past when they fought iraq and won
it becomes critical to find a symbol that will pull together all iranians muslims and non-muslims christians zoroastrians jews living in iran people who are devout not devout
and the obvious emblem is cyrus
so when the british museum and tehran national musuem cooperate and work together as we 've been doing the iranians ask for one thing only as a loan
it 's the only object they want
they want to borrow the cyrus cylinder
and last year the cyrus cylinder went to tehran for the second time
it 's shown being presented here put into its case by the director of the national museum of tehran one of the many women in iran in very senior positions mrs. ardakani
it was a huge event
this is the other side of that same picture
it 's seen in tehran by between one and two million people in the space of a few months
this is beyond any blockbuster exhibition in the west
and it 's the subject of a huge debate about what this cylinder means what cyrus means but above all cyrus as articulated through this cylinder cyrus as the defender of the homeland the champion of course of iranian identity and of the iranian peoples tolerant of all faiths
and in the current iran zoroastrians and christians have guaranteed places in the iranian parliament something to be very very proud of
to see this object in tehran thousands of jews living in iran came to tehran to see it
it became a great emblem a great subject of debate about what iran is at home and abroad
is iran still to be the defender of the oppressed
will iran set free the people that the tyrants have enslaved and expropriated
this is heady national rhetoric and it was all put together in a great pageant launching the return
here you see this out-sized cyrus cylinder on the stage with great figures from iranian history gathering to take their place in the heritage of iran
it was a narrative presented by the president himself
and for me to take this object to iran to be allowed to take this object to iran was to be allowed to be part of an extraordinary debate led at the highest levels about what iran is what different irans there are and how the different histories of iran might shape the world today
it 's a debate that 's still continuing and it will continue to rumble because this object is one of the great declarations of a human aspiration
it stands with the american constitution
it certainly says far more about real freedoms than magna carta
it is a document that can mean so many things for iran and for the region
a replica of this is at the united nations
in new york this autumn it will be present when the great debates about the future of the middle east take place
and i want to finish by asking you what the next story will be in which this object figures
it will appear certainly in many more middle eastern stories
and what story of the middle east what story of the world do you want to see reflecting what is said what is expressed in this cylinder
the right of peoples to live together in the same state worshiping differently freely a middle east a world in which religion is not the subject of division or of debate
in the world of the middle east at the moment the debates are as you know shrill
but i think it 's possible that the most powerful and the wisest voice of all of them may well be the voice of this mute thing the cyrus cylinder
thank you

how many of you have seen the alfred hitchcock film the birds
any of you get really freaked out by that
you might want to leave now
so this is a vending machine for crows
and over the past few days many of you have been asking me how did you come to this how did you get started doing this
and it started as with many great ideas or many ideas you can 't get rid of anyway at a cocktail party
about 10 years ago i was at a cocktail party with a friend of mine and we 're sitting there and he was complaining about the crows that he had seen that were all over his yard and making a big mess
and he was telling me that really we ought to try and eradicate these things
we gotta kill them because they 're making a mess
i said that was stupid you know maybe we should just train them to do something useful
and he said that was impossible
and i 'm sure i 'm in good company in finding that tremendously annoying when someone tells you it 's impossible
so i spent the next 10 years reading about crows in my spare time
and after 10 years of this my wife eventually said look you know you gotta do this thing you 've been talking about and build the vending machine
so i did
but part of the reason that i found this interesting is that i started noticing that we are very aware of all the species that are going extinct on the planet as a result of human habitation expansion and no one seems to be paying attention to all the species that are actually living that are surviving
and i 'm talking specifically about synanthropic species which are species that have adapted specifically for human ecologies species like rats and cockroaches and crows
and as i started looking at them i was finding that they had hyper-adapted
they 'd become extremely adept at living with us
and in return we just tried to kill them all the time
and in doing so we were breeding them for parasitism
we were giving them all sorts of reasons to adapt new ways
so for example rats are incredibly responsive breeders
and cockroaches as anyone who 's tried to get rid of them knows have become really immune to the poisons that we 're using
so i thought let 's build something that 's mutually beneficial
well then let 's build something that we can both benefit from and find some way to make a new relationship with these species
and so i built the vending machine
but the story of the vending machine is a little more interesting if you know more about crows
it turns out that crows aren 't just surviving with human beings they 're actually really thriving
they 're found everywhere on the planet except for the arctic and the southern tip of south america
and in all that area they 're only rarely found breeding more than five kilometers away from human beings
so we may not think about them but they 're always around
and not surprisingly given the human population growth more than half of the human population is living in cities now
and out of those nine-tenths of the human growth population is occurring in cities
we 're seeing a population boom with crows
so bird counts are indicating that we might be seeing up to exponential growth in their numbers
so that 's no great surprise
but what was really interesting to me was to find out that the birds were adapting in a pretty unusual way
and i 'll give you an example of that
so this is betty she 's a new caledonian crow
and these crows use sticks in the wild to get insects and whatnot out of pieces of wood
here she 's trying to get a piece of meat out of a tube
but the researchers had a problem
they messed up and left just a stick of wire in there
and she hadn 't had the opportunity to do this before
you see it wasn 't working very well
so she adapted
now this is completely unprompted she had never seen this done before
no one taught her to bend this into a hook had shown her how it could happen
but she did it all on her own
so keep in mind that she 's never seen this done
right
yeah all right
that 's the part where the researchers freak out
so it turns out we 've been finding more and more that crows are really really intelligent
their brains are proportionate in the same proportion as chimpanzee brains are
there are all kinds of anecdotes for different kinds of intelligence they have
for example in sweden crows will wait for fishermen to drop lines through holes in the ice
and when the fishermen move off the crows fly down reel up the lines and eat the fish or the bait
it 's pretty annoying for the fishermen
on an entirely different tack at university of washington they a few years ago were doing an experiment where they captured some crows on campus
some students went out and netted some crows brought them in and were weighed them and measured them and whatnot and then let them back out again
and were entertained to discover that for the rest of the week these crows whenever these particular students walked around campus these crows would caw at them and run around and make their life kind of miserable
they were significantly less entertained when this went on for the next week
and the next month and after summer break
until they finally graduated and left campus and glad to get away i 'm sure came back sometime later and found the crows still remembered them
so the moral being don 't piss off crows
so now students at the university of washington that are studying these crows do so with a giant wig and a big mask
it 's fairly interesting
so we know that these crows are really smart but the more i dug into this the more i found that they actually have an even more significant adaptation
crows have become highly skilled at making a living in these new urban environments
in this japanese city they have devised a way of eating a food that normally they can 't manage drop it among the traffic
the problem now is collecting the bits without getting run over
wait for the light to stop the traffic
then collect your cracked nut in safety
joshua klein yeah yeah pretty interesting
so what 's significant about this isn 't that crows are using cars to crack nuts
in fact that 's old hat for crows
this happened about 10 years ago in a place called sendai city at a driving school in the suburbs of tokyo
and since that time all of the crows in the neighborhood are picking up this behavior
and now every crow within five kilometers is standing by a sidewalk waiting to collect its lunch
so they 're learning from each other and research bears this out
parents seem to be teaching their young
they 've learned from their peers they 've learned from their enemies
if i have a little extra time i 'll tell you about a case of crow infidelity that illustrates that nicely
the point being that they 've developed cultural adaptation
and as we heard yesterday that 's the pandora 's box that 's getting human beings in trouble and we 're starting to see it with them
they 're able to very quickly and very flexibly adapt to new challenges and new resources in their environment which is really useful if you live in a city
so we know that there 's lots of crows
we found out they 're really smart and we found out that they can teach each other
and when all this became clear to me i realized the only obvious thing to do is build a vending machine
so that 's what we did
this is a vending machine for crows
and it uses skinnerian training to shape their behavior over four stages
it 's pretty simple
basically what happens is that we put this out in a field or someplace where there 's lots of crows and we put coins and peanuts all around the base of the machine
and crows eventually come by and eat the peanuts and get used to the machine being there
and eventually they eat up all the peanuts
and then they see that there are peanuts here on the feeder tray and they hop up and help themselves
and then they leave and the machine spits up more coins and peanuts and life is really dandy if you 're a crow
then you can come back anytime and get yourself a peanut
so when they get really used to that we move on to the crows coming back
now they 're used to the sound of the machine and they keep coming back and digging out these peanuts from amongst the pile of coins that 's there
and when they get really happy about this we go ahead and stymie them
and we move to the third stage where we only give them a coin
now like most of us who have gotten used to a good thing this really pisses them off
so they do what they do in nature when they 're looking for something they sweep things out of the way with their beak
and they do that here and that knocks the coins down the slot and when that happens they get a peanut
and so this goes on for some time
the crows learn that all they have to do is show up wait for the coin to come out put the coin in the slot and then they get their peanut
and when they 're really good and comfortable with that we move to the final stage in which they show up and nothing happens
and this is where we see the difference between crows and other animals
squirrels for example would show up look for the peanut go away
come back look for the peanut go away
they do this maybe half a dozen times before they get bored and then they go off and play in traffic
crows on the other hand show up and they try and figure it out
they know that this machine 's been messing with them through three different stages of behavior
they figure it 's gotta have more to it
so they poke at it and peck at it and whatnot
and eventually some crow gets a bright idea that hey there 's lots of coins lying around from the first stage lying around on the ground hops down picks it up drops it in the slot
and then we 're off to the races
that crow enjoys a temporary monopoly on peanuts until his friends figure out how to do it and then there we go
so what 's significant about this to me isn 't that we can train crows to pick up peanuts
mind you there 's 216 million dollars worth of change lost every year but i 'm not sure i can depend on that roi from crows
instead i think we should look a little bit larger
i think that crows can be trained to do other things
for example why not train them to pick up garbage after stadium events
or find expensive components from discarded electronics
or maybe do search and rescue
the main thing the main point of all this for me is that we can find mutually beneficial systems for these species
we can find ways to interact with these other species that doesn 't involve exterminating them but involves finding an equilibrium with them that 's a useful balance
thanks very much
what we 're really here to talk about is the how
okay so how exactly do we create this world-shattering if you will innovation
now i want to tell you a quick story
we 'll go back a little more than a year
in fact the date i 'm curious to know if any of you know what happened on this momentous date
it was february 3rd 2008
anyone remember what happened february 3rd 2008
super bowl i heard it over here it was the date of the super bowl
and the reason that this date was so momentous is that what my colleagues john king and halee fischer-wright and i noticed as we began to debrief various super bowl parties is that it seemed to us that across the united states if you will tribal councils had convened
and they had discussed things of great national importance
like do we like the budweiser commercial
and do we like the nachos and who is going to win
but they also talked about which candidate they were going to support
and if you go back in time to february 3rd it looked like hilary clinton was going to get the democratic nomination
and there were even some polls that were saying she was going to go all the way
but when we talked to people it appeared that a funnel effect had happened in these tribes all across the united states
now what is a tribe a tribe is a group of about 20 so kind of more than a team 20 to about 150 people
and it 's within these tribes that all of our work gets done
but not just work it 's within these tribes that societies get built that important things happen
and so as we surveyed the if you will representatives from various tribal councils that met also known as super bowl parties we sent the following email off to 40 newspaper editors the following day
february 4th we posted it on our website this was before super tuesday
we said the tribes that we 're in are saying it 's going to be obama
now the reason we knew that was because we spent the previous 10 years studying tribes studying these naturally occurring groups
all of you are members of tribes
in walking around at the break many of you had met members of your tribe and you were talking to them
and many of you were doing what great if you will tribal leaders do which is to find someone who is a member of a tribe and to find someone else who is another member of a different tribe and make introductions
that is in fact what great tribal leaders do
so here is the bottom line
if you focus in on a group like this this happens to be a usc game and you zoom in with one of those super satellite cameras and do magnification factors so you could see individual people you would in fact see not a single crowd just like there is not a single crowd here but you would see these tribes that are then coming together
and from a distance it appears that it 's a single group
and so people form tribes
they always have they always will
just as fish swim and birds fly people form tribes it 's just what we do
but here 's the rub
not all tribes are the same and what makes the difference is the culture
now here is the net out of this
you 're all a member of tribes
if you can find a way to take the tribes that you 're in and nudge them forward along these tribal stages to what we call stage five which is the top of the mountain
but we 're going to start with what we call stage one
now this is the lowest of the stages
you don 't want this okay
this is a bit of a difficult image to put up on the screen
but it 's one that i think we need to learn from
stage one produces people who do horrible things
this is the kid who shot up virginia tech
stage one is a group where people systematically sever relationships from functional tribes and then pool together with people who think like they do
stage one is literally the culture of gangs and it is the culture of prisons
now again we don 't often deal with stage one
and i want to make the point that as members of society we need to
it 's not enough to simply write people off
but let 's move on to stage two
now stage one you 'll notice says in effect life sucks
so this other book that steve mentioned that just came out called the three laws of performance my colleague steve zaffron and i argue that as people see the world so they behave
well if people see the world in such a way that life sucks then their behavior will follow automatically from that
it will be despairing hostility
they 'll do whatever it takes to survive even if that means undermining other people
now my birthday is coming up shortly and my driver 's license expires
and the reason that that 's relevant is that very soon i will be walking into what we call a stage two tribe which looks like this
now am i saying that in every department of motor vehicles across the land you find a stage two culture
no but in the one near me where i have to go in just a few days what i will say when i 'm standing in line is how can people be so dumb and yet live
now am i saying that there are dumb people working here
actually no i 'm not
but i 'm saying the culture makes people dumb
so in a stage two culture and we find these in all sorts of different places you find them in fact in the best organizations in the world
you find them in all places in society
i 've come across them at the organizations that everybody raves about as being best in class
but here is the point if you believe and you say to people in your tribe in effect my life sucks
i mean if i got to go to tedx usc my life wouldn 't suck but i don 't so it does
if that 's how you talked imagine what kind of work would get done
what kind of innovation would get done
the amount of world-changing behavior that would happen
in fact it would be basically nil
now when we go on to stage three this is the one that hits closest to home for many of us
because it is in stage three that many of us move
and we park and we stay
stage three says i 'm great and you 're not
i 'm great and you 're not
now imagine having a whole room of people saying in effect i 'm great and you 're not
or i 'm going to find some way to compete with you and come out on top as a result of that
a whole group of people communicating that way talking that way
i know this sounds like a joke three doctors walk into a bar
but in this case three doctors walk into an elevator
i happened to be in the elevator collecting data for this book
and one doctor said to the others did you see my article in the new england journal of medicine
and the other said no that 's great congratulations
the next one got kind of a wry smile on his face and said well while you were you know doing your research notice the condescending tone while you were off doing your research i was off doing more surgeries than anyone else in the department of surgery at this institution
and the third one got the same wry smile and said well while you were off doing your research and you were off doing your monkey meatball surgery that eventually we 'll train monkeys to do or cells or robots or maybe not even need to do it at all i was off running the future of the residency program which is really the future of medicine
and they all kind of laughed and they patted him on the back
and the elevator door opened and they all walked out
that is a meeting of a stage three tribe
now we find these in places where really smart successful people show up
like oh i don 't know tedx usc
here is the greatest challenge we face in innovation
it is moving from stage three to stage four
let 's take a look at a quick video snippet
this is from a company called zappos located outside las vegas
and my question on the other side is just going to be what do you think they value
it was not christmas time there was a christmas tree
this is their lobby
employees volunteer time in the advice booth
notice it looks like something out of a peanuts cartoon
okay we 're going through the hallway here at zappos
this is a call center notice how it 's decorated
notice people are applauding for us
they don 't know who we are and they don 't care and if they did they probably wouldn 't applaud
but you 'll notice the level of excitement
notice again how they decorate their office
now what 's important to people at zappos these may not be the things that are important to you
but they value things like fun and they value creativity
one of their stated values is be a little bit weird
and you 'll notice they are a little bit weird
so when individuals come together and find something that unites them that 's greater than their individual competence then something very important happens
the group gels and it changes from a group of highly motivated but fairly individually-centric people into something larger into a tribe that becomes aware of its own existence
stage four tribes can do remarkable things
but you 'll notice we 're not at the top of the mountain yet
there is in fact another stage
now some of you may not recognize the scene that 's up here
and if you take a look at the headline of stage five which is life is great this may seem a little incongruous
this is a scene or snippet from the truth and reconciliation process in south africa for which desmond tutu won the nobel prize
now think about that south africa terrible atrocities had happened in the society
and people came together focused only on those two values truth and reconciliation
there was no road map no one had ever done anything like this before
and in this atmosphere where the only guidance was people 's values and their noble cause what this group accomplished was historic
and people at the time feared that south africa would end up going the way that rwanda has gone descending into one skirmish after another in a civil war that seems to have no end
in fact south africa has not gone down that road
largely because people like desmond tutu set up a stage five process to involve the thousands and perhaps millions of tribes in the country to bring everyone together
so people hear this and they conclude the following as did we in doing the study
okay got it i don 't want to talk stage one
that 's like you know life sucks who wants to talk that way
i don 't want to talk like they do at the particular dmv that 's close to where dave lives
i really don 't want to just say i 'm great because that kind of sounds narcissistic and then i won 't have any friends
saying we 're great that sounds pretty good
but i should really talk stage five right life is great
well in fact there are three somewhat counter-intuitive findings that come out of all this
the first one if you look at the declaration of independence and actually read it the phrase that sticks in many of our minds is things about inalienable rights
i mean that 's stage five right life is great oriented only by our values no other guidance
in fact most of the document is written at stage two
my life sucks because i live under a tyrant also known as king george
we 're great who is not great england
sorry
well what about other great leaders what about gandhi
what about martin luther king
i mean surely these were just people who preached life is great right
just one little bit of happiness and joy after another
in fact martin luther king 's most famous line was at stage three
he didn 't say we have a dream he said i have a dream
why did he do that because most people are not at stage five
two percent are at stage one
about 25 percent are at stage two saying in effect my life sucks
48 percent of working tribes say these are employed tribes say i 'm great and you 're not
and we have to duke it out every day so we resort to politics
only about 22 percent of tribes are at stage four oriented by our values saying we 're great
and our values are beginning to unite us
only two percent only two percent of tribes get to stage five
and those are the ones that change the world
so the first little finding from this is that leaders need to be able to talk all the levels so that you can touch every person in society
but you don 't leave them where you found them okay
tribes can only hear one level above and below where they are
so we have to have the ability to talk all the levels to go to where they are
and then leaders nudge people within their tribes to the next level
i 'd like to show you some examples of this
one of the people we interviewed was frank jordan former mayor of san francisco before that he was chief of police in san francisco
and he grew up essentially in stage one
and you know what changed his life it was walking into one of these a boys and girls club
now here is what happened to this person who eventually became mayor of san francisco
he went from being alive and passionate at stage one remember life sucks despairing hostility i will do whatever it takes to survive to walking into a boys and girls club folding his arms sitting down in a chair and saying wow my life really sucks
i don 't know anybody
i mean if i was into boxing like they were then my life wouldn 't suck but i don 't so it does
so i 'm going to sit here in my chair and not do anything
in fact that 's progress
we move people from stage one to stage two by getting them in a new tribe and then over time getting them connected
so what about moving from stage three to stage four
i want to argue that we 're doing that right here
ted represents a set of values and as we unite around these values something really interesting begins to emerge
if you want this experience to live on as something historic then at the reception tonight i 'd like to encourage you to do something beyond what people normally do and call networking
which is not just to meet new people and extend your reach extend your influence but instead find someone you don 't know and find someone else you don 't know and introduce them
that 's called a triadic relationship
see people who build world-changing tribes do that
they extend the reach of their tribes by connecting them not just to myself so that my following is greater but i connect people who don 't know each other to something greater than themselves
and ultimately that adds to their values
but we 're not done yet because then how do we go from stage four which is great to stage five
the story that i like to end with is this it comes out of a place called the gallup organization
you know they do polls right
so it 's stage four we 're great who is not great
pretty much everybody else who does polls
if gallup releases a poll on the same day that nbc releases a poll people will pay attention to the gallup poll okay we understand that
so they were bored
they wanted to change the world so here is the question someone asked
how could we instead of just polling what asia thinks or what the united states thinks or who thinks what about obama versus mccain or something like that what does the entire world think
and they found a way to do the first-ever world poll
they had people involved who were nobel laureates in economics who reported being bored
and suddenly they pulled out sheets of paper and were trying to figure out how do we survey the population of sub-saharan africa
how do we survey populations that don 't have access to technology and speak languages we don 't speak and we don 't know anyone who speaks those languages because in order to achieve on this great mission we have to be able to do it
incidentally they did pull it off
and they released the first-ever world poll
so i 'd like to leave you with these thoughts
first of all we all form tribes all of us
you 're in tribes here hopefully you 're extending the reach of the tribes that you have
but the question on the table is this what kind of an impact are the tribes that you are in making
you 're hearing one presentation after another often representing a group of people a tribe about how they have changed the world
if you do what we 've talked about you listen for how people actually communicate in the tribes that you 're in
and you don 't leave them where they are you nudge them forward
you remember to talk all five culture stages
because we 've got people in all five around us
and the question that i 'd like to leave you with is this will your tribes change the world
thank you very much
the greatest irony in global health is that the poorest countries carry the largest disease burden
if we resize the countries of the globe in proportion to the subject of interest we see that sub-saharan africa is the worst hit region by hiv aids
this is the most devastating epidemic of our time
we also see that this region has the least capability in terms of dealing with the disease
there are very few doctors and quite frankly these countries do not have the resources that are needed to cope with such epidemics
so what the western countries developed countries have generously done is they have proposed to provide free drugs to all people in third world countries who actually can 't afford these medications
and this has already saved millions of lives and it has prevented entire economies from capsizing in sub-saharan africa
but there is a fundamental problem that is killing the efforts in fighting this disease because if you keep throwing drugs out at people who don 't have diagnostic services you end up creating a problem of drug resistance
this is already beginning to happen in sub-saharan africa
the problem is that what begins as a tragedy in the third world could easily become a global problem
and the last thing we want to see is drug-resistant strains of hiv popping up all over the world because it will make treatment more expensive and it could also restore the pre-arv carnage of hiv aids
i experienced this firsthand as a high school student in uganda
this was in the 90s during the peak of the hiv epidemic before there were any arvs in sub-saharan africa
and during that time i actually lost more relatives as well as the teachers who taught me to hiv aids
so this became one of the driving passions of my life to help find real solutions that could address these kinds of problems
we all know about the miracle of miniaturization
back in the day computers used to fill this entire room and people actually used to work inside the computers
but what electronic miniaturization has done is that it has allowed people to shrink technology into a cell phone
and i 'm sure everyone here enjoys cell phones that can actually be used in the remote areas of the world in the third world countries
the good news is that the same technology that allowed miniaturization of electronics is now allowing us to miniaturize biological laboratories
so right now we can actually miniaturize biological and chemistry laboratories onto microfluidic chips
i was very lucky to come to the us right after high school and was able to work on this technology and develop some devices
this is a microfluidic chip that i developed
a close look at how the technology works these are channels that are about the size of a human hair so you have integrated valves pumps mixers and injectors so you can fit entire diagnostic experiments onto a microfluidic system
so what i plan to do with this technology is to actually take the current state of the technology and build an hiv kit in a microfluidic system
so with one microfluidic chip which is the size of an iphone you can actually diagnose 100 patients at the same time
for each patient we will be able to do up to 100 different viral loads per patient
and this is only done in four hours 50 times faster than the current state of the art at a cost that will be five to 500 times cheaper than the current options
so this will allow us to create personalized medicines in the third world at a cost that is actually achievable and make the world a safer place
i invite your interest as well as your involvement in driving this vision to a point of practical reality
thank you very much
do you know how many species of flowering plants there are
there are a quarter of a million at least those are the ones we know about a quarter of a million species of flowering plants
and flowers are a real bugger
they 're really difficult for plants to produce
they take an enormous amount of energy and a lot of resources
why would they go to that bother
and the answer of course like so many things in the world is sex
i know what 's on your mind when you 're looking at these pictures
and the reason that sexual reproduction is so important there are lots of other things that plants can do to reproduce
you can take cuttings they can sort of have sex with themselves they can pollinate themselves
but they really need to spread their genes to mix with other genes so that they can adapt to environmental niches
evolution works that way
now the way that plants transmit that information is through pollen
some of you may have seen some of these pictures before
as i say every home should have a scanning electron microscope to be able to see these
and there is as many different kinds of pollen as there are flowering plants
and that 's actually rather useful for forensics and so on
most pollen that causes hay fever for us is from plants that use the wind to disseminate the pollen and that 's a very inefficient process which is why it gets up our noses so much
because you have to chuck out masses and masses of it hoping that your sex cells your male sex cells which are held within the pollen will somehow reach another flower just by chance
so all the grasses which means all of the cereal crops and most of the trees have wind-borne pollen
but most species actually use insects to do their bidding and that 's more intelligent in a way because the pollen they don 't need so much of it
the insects and other species can take the pollen transfer it directly to where it 's required
so we 're aware obviously of the relationship between insects and plants
there 's a symbiotic relationship there whether it 's flies or birds or bees they 're getting something in return and that something in return is generally nectar
sometimes that symbiosis has led to wonderful adaptations the hummingbird hawk-moth is beautiful in its adaptation
the plant gets something and the hawk-moth spreads the pollen somewhere else
plants have evolved to create little landing strips here and there for bees that might have lost their way
there are markings on many plants that look like other insects
these are the anthers of a lily cleverly done so that when the unsuspecting insect lands on it the anther flips up and whops it on the back with a great load of pollen that it then goes to another plant with
and there 's an orchid that might look to you as if it 's got jaws and in a way it has it forces the insect to crawl out getting covered in pollen that it takes somewhere else
orchids there are 20,000 at least species of orchids amazingly amazingly diverse
and they get up to all sorts of tricks
they have to try and attract pollinators to do their bidding
this orchid known as darwin 's orchid because it 's one that he studied and made a wonderful prediction when he saw it you can see that there 's a very long nectar tube that descends down from the orchid
and basically what the insect has to do we 're in the middle of the flower it has to stick its little proboscis right into the middle of that and all the way down that nectar tube to get to the nectar
and darwin said looking at this flower i guess something has coevolved with this
and sure enough there 's the insect
and i mean normally it kind of rolls it away but in its erect form that 's what it looks like
now you can imagine that if nectar is such a valuable thing and expensive for the plant to produce and it attracts lots of pollinators then just as in human sex people might start to deceive
they might say i 've got a bit of nectar do you want to come and get it
now this is a plant
this is a plant here that insects in south africa just love and they 've evolved with a long proboscis to get the nectar at the bottom
and this is the mimic
so this is a plant that is mimicking the first plant
and here is the long-probosced fly that has not gotten any nectar from the mimic because the mimic doesn 't give it any nectar it thought it would get some
so not only has the fly not got the nectar from the mimic plant it 's also if you look very closely just at the head end you can see that it 's got a bit of pollen that it would be transmitting to another plant if only some botanist hadn 't come along and stuck it to a blue piece of card
now deceit carries on through the plant kingdom
this flower with its black dots they might look like black dots to us but if i tell you to a male insect of the right species that looks like two females who are really really hot to trot
and when the insect gets there and lands on it dousing itself in pollen of course that it 's going to take to another plant if you look at the every-home-should-have-one scanning electron microscope picture you can see that there are actually some patterning there which is three-dimensional
so it probably even feels good for the insect as well as looking good
and these electron microscope pictures here 's one of an orchid mimicking an insect you can see that different parts of the structure have different colors and different textures to our eye have very very different textures to what an insect might perceive
and this one is evolved to mimic a glossy metallic surface you see on some beetles
and under the scanning electron microscope you can see the surface there really quite different from the other surfaces we looked at
sometimes the whole plant mimics an insect even to us
i mean i think that looks like some sort of flying animal or beast
it 's a wonderful amazing thing
this one 's clever it 's called obsidian
i think of it as insidium sometimes
to the right species of bee this looks like another very aggressive bee and it goes and bonks it on the head lots and lots of times to try and drive it away and of course covers itself with pollen
the other thing it does is that this plant mimics another orchid that has a wonderful store of food for insects
and this one doesn 't have anything for them
so it 's deceiving on two levels fabulous
here we see ylang ylang the component of many perfumes
i actually smelt someone with some on earlier
and the flowers don 't really have to be that gaudy
they 're sending out a fantastic array of scent to any insect that 'll have it
this one doesn 't smell so good
this is a flower that really really smells pretty nasty and is designed again evolved to look like carrion
so flies love this
they fly in and they pollinate
this which is helicodiceros is also known as dead horse arum
i don 't know what a dead horse actually smells like but this one probably smells pretty much like it
it 's really horrible
and blowflies just can 't help themselves
they fly into this thing and they fly all the way down it
they lay their eggs in it thinking it 's a nice bit of carrion and not realizing that there 's no food for the eggs that the eggs are going to die but the plant meanwhile has benefited because the bristles release and the flies disappear to pollinate the next flower fantastic
here 's arum arum maculatum lords and ladies or cuckoo-pint in this country
i photographed this thing last week in dorset
this thing heats up by about 15 degrees above ambient temperature amazing
and if you look down into it there 's this sort of dam past the spadix flies get attracted by the heat which is boiling off volatile chemicals little midges and they get trapped underneath in this container
they drink this fabulous nectar and then they 're all a bit sticky
at night they get covered in pollen which showers down over them and then the bristles that we saw above they sort of wilt and allow all these midges out covered in pollen fabulous thing
now if you think that 's fabulous this is one of my great favorites
this is the philodendron selloum
for anyone here from brazil you 'll know about this plant
this is the most amazing thing
that sort of phallic bit there is about a foot long
and it does something that no other plant that i know of does and that is that when it flowers that 's the spadix in the middle there for a period of about two days it metabolizes in a way which is rather similar to mammals
so instead of having starch which is the food of plants it takes something rather similar to brown fat and burns it at such a rate that it 's burning fat metabolizing about the rate of a small cat
and that 's twice the energy output weight for weight than a hummingbird absolutely astonishing
this thing does something else which is unusual
not only will it raise itself to 115 fahrenheit 43 or 44 degrees centigrade for two days but it keeps constant temperature
there 's a thermoregulation mechanism in there that keeps constant temperature
now why does it do this i hear you ask
now wouldn 't you know it there 's some beetles that just love to make love at that temperature
and they get inside and they get it all on
and the plant showers them with pollen and off they go and pollinate
and what a wonderful thing it is
now most pollinators that we think about are insects but actually in the tropics many birds and butterflies pollinate
and many of the tropical flowers are red and that 's because butterflies and birds see similarly to us we think and can see the color red very well
but if you look at the spectrum birds and us we see red green and blue and see that spectrum
insects see green blue and ultraviolet and they see various shades of ultraviolet
so there 's something that goes on off the end there
and wouldn 't it be great if we could somehow see what that is i hear you ask
well yes we can
so what is an insect seeing
last week i took these pictures of rock rose helianthemum in dorset
these are little yellow flowers like we all see little yellow flowers all over the place
and this is what it looks like with visible light
this is what it looks like if you take out the red
most bees don 't perceive red
and then i put some ultraviolet filters on my camera and took a very very long exposure with the particular frequencies of ultraviolet light and this is what i got
and that 's a real fantastic bull 's eye
now we don 't know exactly what a bee sees any more than you know what i 'm seeing when i call this red
we can 't know what 's going on in let alone an insect 's another human being 's mind
but the contrast will look something like that so standing out a lot from the background
here 's another little flower different range of ultraviolet frequencies different filters to match the pollinators
and that 's the sort of thing that it would be seeing
just in case you think that all yellow flowers have this property no flower was damaged in the process of this shot it was just attached to the tripod not killed then under ultraviolet light look at that
and that could be the basis of a sunscreen because sunscreens work by absorbing ultraviolet light
so maybe the chemical in that would be useful
finally there 's one of evening primrose that bjorn rorslett from norway sent me fantastic hidden pattern
and i love the idea of something hidden
i think there 's something poetic here that these pictures taken with ultraviolet filter the main use of that filter is for astronomers to take pictures of venus actually the clouds of venus
that 's the main use of that filter
venus of course is the god of love and fertility which is the flower story
and just as flowers spend a lot of effort trying to get pollinators to do their bidding they 've also somehow managed to persuade us to plant great fields full of them and give them to each other at times of birth and death and particularly at marriage which when you think of it is the moment that encapsulates the transfer of genetic material from one organism to another
thank you very much
the theme of my talk today is be an artist right now
most people when this subject is brought up get tense and resist it art doesn 't feed me and right now i 'm busy
i have to go to school get a job send my kids to lessons ... you think i 'm too busy i don 't have time for art
there are hundreds of reasons why we can 't be artists right now
don 't they just pop into your head
there are so many reasons why we can 't be indeed we 're not sure why we should be
we don 't know why we should be artists but we have many reasons why we can 't be
why do people instantly resist the idea of associating themselves with art
perhaps you think art is for the greatly gifted or for the thoroughly and professionally trained
and some of you may think you 've strayed too far from art
well you might have but i don 't think so
this is the theme of my talk today
we are all born artists
if you have kids you know what i mean
almost everything kids do is art
they draw with crayons on the wall
they dance to son dam bi 's dance on tv but you can 't even call it son dam bi 's dance it becomes the kids own dance
so they dance a strange dance and inflict their singing on everyone
perhaps their art is something only their parents can bear and because they practice such art all day long people honestly get a little tired around kids
kids will sometimes perform monodramas playing house is indeed a monodrama or a play
and some kids when they get a bit older start to lie
usually parents remember the very first time their kid lies
they 're shocked
now you 're showing your true colors mom says she thinks why does he take after his dad
she questions him what kind of a person are you going to be
but you shouldn 't worry
the moment kids start to lie is the moment storytelling begins
they are talking about things they didn 't see
it 's amazing it 's a wonderful moment
parents should celebrate
hurray my boy finally started to lie
all right it calls for celebration
for example a kid says mom guess what i met an alien on my way home
then a typical mom responds stop that nonsense
now an ideal parent is someone who responds like this really an alien huh what did it look like did it say anything
where did you meet it um in front of the supermarket
when you have a conversation like this the kid has to come up with the next thing to say to be responsible for what he started
soon a story develops
of course this is an infantile story but thinking up one sentence after the next is the same thing a professional writer like me does
in essence they are not different
roland barthes once said of flaubert 's novels flaubert did not write a novel
he merely connected one sentence after another
the eros between sentences that is the essence of flaubert 's novel
that 's right a novel basically is writing one sentence then without violating the scope of the first one writing the next sentence
and you continue to make connections
take a look at this sentence yes it 's the first sentence of franz kafka 's the metamorphosis
writing such an unjustifiable sentence and continuing in order to justify it kafka 's work became the masterpiece of contemporary literature
kafka did not show his work to his father
he was not on good terms with his father
on his own he wrote these sentences
had he shown his father my boy has finally lost it he would 've thought
and that 's right art is about going a little nuts and justifying the next sentence which is not much different from what a kid does
a kid who has just started to lie is taking the first step as a storyteller
kids do art
they don 't get tired and they have fun doing it
i was in jeju island a few days ago
when kids are on the beach most of them love playing in the water
but some of them spend a lot of time in the sand making mountains and seas well not seas but different things people and dogs etc
but parents tell them it will all be washed away by the waves
in other words it 's useless
there 's no need
but kids don 't mind
they have fun in the moment and they keep playing in the sand
kids don 't do it because someone told them to
they aren 't told by their boss or anyone they just do it
when you were little i bet you spent time enjoying the pleasure of primitive art
when i ask my students to write about their happiest moment many write about an early artistic experience they had as a kid
learning to play piano for the first time and playing four hands with a friend or performing a ridiculous skit with friends looking like idiots things like that
or the moment you developed the first film you shot with an old camera
they talk about these kinds of experiences
you must have had such a moment
in that moment art makes you happy because it 's not work
work doesn 't make you happy does it mostly it 's tough
the french writer michel tournier has a famous saying
it 's a bit mischievous actually
work is against human nature the proof is that it makes us tired
right why would work tire us if it 's in our nature
playing doesn 't tire us
we can play all night long
if we work overnight we should be paid for overtime
why because it 's tiring and we feel fatigue
but kids usually they do art for fun it 's playing
they don 't draw to sell the work to a client or play the piano to earn money for the family
of course there were kids who had to
you know this gentleman right
he had to tour around europe to support his family wolfgang amadeus mozart but that was centuries ago so we can make him an exception
unfortunately at some point our art such a joyful pastime ends
kids have to go to lessons to school do homework and of course they take piano or ballet lessons but they aren 't fun anymore
you 're told to do it and there 's competition how can it be fun
if you 're in elementary school and you still draw on the wall you 'll surely get in trouble with your mom
besides if you continue to act like an artist as you get older you 'll increasingly feel pressure people will question your actions and ask you to act properly
here 's my story i was an eighth grader and i entered a drawing contest at school in gyeongbokgung
i was trying my best and my teacher came around and asked me what are you doing
i 'm drawing diligently i said
why are you using only black
indeed i was eagerly coloring the sketchbook in black
and i explained it 's a dark night and a crow is perching on a branch
then my teacher said really well young-ha you may not be good at drawing but you have a talent for storytelling
or so i wished
now you 'll get it you rascal was the response
you 'll get it he said
you were supposed to draw the palace the gyeonghoeru etc but i was coloring everything in black so he dragged me out of the group
there were a lot of girls there as well so i was utterly mortified
none of my explanations or excuses were heard and i really got it big time
if he was an ideal teacher he would have responded like i said before young-ha may not have a talent for drawing but he has a gift for making up stories and he would have encouraged me
but such a teacher is seldom found
later i grew up and went to europe 's galleries i was a university student and i thought this was really unfair
look what i found
works like this were hung in basel while i was punished and stood in front of the palace with my drawing in my mouth
look at this doesn 't it look just like wallpaper
contemporary art i later discovered isn 't explained by a lame story like mine
no crows are brought up
most of the works have no title untitled
anyways contemporary art in the 20th century is about doing something weird and filling the void with explanation and interpretation essentially the same as i did
of course my work was very amateur but let 's turn to more famous examples
this is picasso 's
he stuck handlebars into a bike seat and called it bull 's head sounds convincing right
next a urinal was placed on its side and called fountain
that was duchamp
so filling the gap between explanation and a weird act with stories that 's indeed what contemporary art is all about
picasso even made the statement i draw not what i see but what i think
yes it means i didn 't have to draw gyeonghoeru
i wish i knew what picasso said back then i could have argued better with my teacher
unfortunately the little artists within us are choked to death before we get to fight against the oppressors of art
they get locked in
that 's our tragedy
so what happens when little artists get locked in banished or even killed
our artistic desire doesn 't go away
we want to express to reveal ourselves but with the artist dead the artistic desire reveals itself in dark form
in karaoke bars there are always people who sing she 's gone or hotel california miming the guitar riffs
usually they sound awful awful indeed
some people turn into rockers like this
or some people dance in clubs
people who would have enjoyed telling stories end up trolling on the internet all night long
that 's how a writing talent reveals itself on the dark side
sometimes we see dads get more excited than their kids playing with legos or putting together plastic robots
they go don 't touch it daddy will do it for you
the kid has already lost interest and is doing something else but the dad alone builds castles
this shows the artistic impulses inside us are suppressed not gone
but they can often reveal themselves negatively in the form of jealousy
you know the song i would love to be on tv why would we love it
tv is full of people who do what we wished to do but never got to
they dance they act and the more they do they are praised
so we start to envy them
we become dictators with a remote and start to criticize the people on tv
he just can 't act you call that singing she can 't hit the notes
we easily say these sorts of things
we get jealous not because we 're evil but because we have little artists pent up inside us
that 's what i think
what should we do then
yes that 's right
right now we need to start our own art
right this minute we can turn off tv log off the internet get up and start to do something
where i teach students in drama school there 's a course called dramatics
in this course all students must put on a play
however acting majors are not supposed to act
they can write the play for example and the writers may work on stage art
likewise stage art majors may become actors and in this way you put on a show
students at first wonder whether they can actually do it but later they have so much fun i rarely see anyone who is miserable doing a play
in school the military or even in a mental institution once you make people do it they enjoy it
i saw this happen in the army many people had fun doing plays
i have another experience in my writing class i give students a special assignment
i have students like you in the class many who don 't major in writing
some major in art or music and think they can 't write
so i give them blank sheets of paper and a theme
it can be a simple theme write about the most unfortunate experience in your childhood
there 's one condition you must write like crazy like crazy
i walk around and encourage them come on come on they have to write like crazy for an hour or two
they only get to think for the first five minutes
the reason i make them write like crazy is because when you write slowly and lots of thoughts cross your mind the artistic devil creeps in
this devil will tell you hundreds of reasons why you can 't write people will laugh at you this is not good writing
what kind of sentence is this look at your handwriting
it will say a lot of things
you have to run fast so the devil can 't catch up
the really good writing i 've seen in my class was not from the assignments with a long deadline but from the 40- to 60-minute crazy writing students did in front of me with a pencil
the students go into a kind of trance
after 30 or 40 minutes they write without knowing what they 're writing
and in this moment the nagging devil disappears
so i can say this it 's not the hundreds of reasons why one can 't be an artist but rather the one reason one must be that makes us artists
why we cannot be something is not important
most artists became artists because of the one reason
when we put the devil in our heart to sleep and start our own art enemies appear on the outside
mostly they have the faces of our parents
sometimes they look like our spouses but they are not your parents or spouses
they are devils devils
they came to earth briefly transformed to stop you from being artistic from becoming artists
and they have a magic question
when we say i think i 'll try acting there 's a drama school in the community center or i 'd like to learn italian songs they ask oh yeah a play what for
the magic question is what for
but art is not for anything
art is the ultimate goal
it saves our souls and makes us live happily
it helps us express ourselves and be happy without the help of alcohol or drugs
so in response to such a pragmatic question we need to be bold
well just for the fun of it sorry for having fun without you is what you should say i 'll just go ahead and do it anyway
the ideal future i imagine is where we all have multiple identities at least one of which is an artist
once i was in new york and got in a cab i took the backseat and in front of me i saw something related to a play
so i asked the driver what is this
he said it was his profile then what are you i asked an actor he said
he was a cabby and an actor i asked what roles do you usually play
he proudly said he played king lear
king lear
who is it that can tell me who i am a great line from king lear
that 's the world i dream of
someone is a golfer by day and writer by night
or a cabby and an actor a banker and a painter secretly or publicly performing their own arts
in 1990 martha graham the legend of modern dance came to korea
the great artist then in her 90s arrived at gimpo airport and a reporter asked her a typical question what do you have to do to become a great dancer
any advice for aspiring korean dancers
now she was the master this photo was taken in 1948 and she was already a celebrated artist
in 1990 she was asked this question
and here 's what she answered just do it
wow i was touched
only those three words and she left the airport that 's it
so what should we do now
let 's be artists right now right away how
just do it
thank you
an event seen from one point of view gives one impression
seen from another point of view it gives quite a different impression
but it 's only when you get the whole picture you can fully understand what 's going on
sasha vucinic it 's a great clip isn 't it
and i found that in 29 seconds it tells more about the power of and importance of independent media than i could say in an hour
so i thought that it will be good to start with it
and also start with a little bit of statistics
according to relevant researchers 83 percent of the population of this planet lives in the societies without independent press
think about that number 83 percent of the population on the whole planet does not really know what is going on in their countries
the information they get gets filtered through somebody who either twists that information or colors that information does something with it
so they 're deprived of understanding their reality
that is just to understand how big and important this problem is
now those of you who are lucky enough to live in those societies that represent 17 percent i think should enjoy it until it lasts
you know sunday morning you flick the paper get your cappuccino
enjoy it while it lasts
because as we heard yesterday countries can lose stars from their flags but they can also lose press freedom as i guess americans among us can tell us more about
but that 's totally another and separate topic
so i can go back to my story
my story starts the story i want to share starts in 1991
at that time i was running b92 the only independent for that matter the only electronic media in the country
and i guess we were sharing we had that regular life of the only independent media in the country operating in hostile environment where government really wants to make your life miserable
and there are different ways
yeah it was the usual cocktail a little bit of threats a little bit of friendly advice a little bit of financial police a little bit of text control so you always have somebody who never leaves your office
but what they really do which is very powerful and that is what governments in the late 90s started doing if they don 't like independent media companies you know they threaten your advertisers
once they threaten your advertisers market forces are actually you know destroyed and the advertisers do not want to come no matter how much does it make sense for them do not want to come and advertise
and you have a problem making ends meet
at that time at the beginning of the 90s we had that problem which was you know survival below one side but what was really painful for me was remember the beginning of the 90s yugoslavia is falling apart
we were sitting over there with a country in a downfall in a slow-motion downfall
and we all had all of that on tapes
we had the ability to understand what was going on
we were actually recording history
the problem was that we had to re-tape that history a week later because if we did not we could not afford enough tapes to keep archives of that history
so if i gave you that picture i don 't want to go too long on that
in that context a gentleman came to my office at that time
it was still 1991
he was running a media systems organization which is still in business the gentleman is still in business
and what did i know at that time about media systems
i would think media systems were organizations which means they should help you
so i prepared two plans for that meeting two strategic plans the small one and the big one
the small one was i just wanted him to help us get those damn tapes so we can keep that archive for the next 50 years
the big plan was to ask him for a 1,000,000-dollar loan
because i thought i still maintain that serious and independent media companies are great business
and i thought that b92 will survive and be a great company once milosevic is gone which turned out to be true
it 's now probably either the biggest or the second biggest media company in the country
and i thought that the only thing that we needed at that time was 1,000,000-dollar loan to take us through those hard times
to make a long story short the gentleman comes into the office great suit and tie
i gave him what i thought was a brilliant explanation of the political situation and explained how hard and difficult the war will be
actually i underestimated the atrocities i have to admit
anyway after that whole big long explanation the only question he had for me and this is not a joke is are we paying royalties after we broadcast music of michael jackson
that was really the only question he had
he left and i remember being actually very angry at myself because i thought there must be an institution in the world that is providing loans to media companies
it 's so obvious straight in your face and somebody must have thought of it
somebody must have started something like that
and i thought i 'm just dumb and i cannot find it
you know in my defense there was no google at that time you could not just google in 91
so i thought that that 's actually my problem
now we go from here fast forward to 1995
i have i left the country i have a meeting with george soros trying for the third time to convince him that his foundation should invest in something that should operate like a media bank
and basically what i was saying is very simple
you know forget about charity it doesn 't work
forget about handouts 20,000 dollars do not help anybody
what you should do is you should treat media companies as a business
it 's business anywhere
media business or any other business it needs to be capitalized
and what these guys need actually is access to capital
so third meeting arguments are pretty well exercised
at the end of the meeting he says look it is not going to work you will never see your money back but my foundations will put 500,000 dollars so you can test the idea
see that it will not work
he said i 'll give you a rope to hang yourself
i knew two things after that meeting
first under no circumstances i want to hang myself
and second that i have no idea how to make it work
you see at the level of a concept it was a great concept
but it 's one thing to have a concept it 's a totally separate thing to actually make it work
so i had absolutely no idea how that could actually work
had the wrong idea i thought that we can be a bank
you see banks i don 't know if there are any bankers over here i apologize in advance but it 's the best job in the world
you know you find somebody who is respectable and has a lot of money
you give them more money they repay you that over a time
you collect interest and do nothing in between
so i thought why don 't we get into that business
so here we are having our first client brilliant
first independent newspaper in slovakia
the government cutting them off from all the printing facilities in bratislava
so here 's the daily newspaper that has to be printed 400 kilometers away from the capital
it 's a daily newspaper with a deadline of 4 p.m.
that means that they have no sports they have no latest news circulation goes down
it 's a kind of very nice sophisticated way how to economically strangle a daily newspaper
they come to us with a request for a loan
they want to the only way for them to survive is to get a printing press
and we said that 's fine let 's meet you 'll bring us your business plan which eventually they did
we start the meeting
i get these two pieces of paper not like this a4 format so it 's much bigger
a lot of numbers there a lot of numbers
but however you put it you know the numbers do not make any sense
and that 's the best they could do
we were the best that they could do
so that is how we understood what our method is
it 's not a bank we had to actually go into these companies and earn our return by fixing them by establishing management systems by providing all that knowledge how do you run a business on one side while they all know how to run how to create content
just quickly on the results
over these 10 years 40 million dollars in affordable financing average interest rate five percent to six percent
lately we are going wild charging seven percent from time to time
we do it in 17 countries of the developing world
and here is the most stunning number
return rate the one that soros was so worried about 97 percent
97 percent of all the scheduled repayments came back to us on time
what do we typically finance
we finance anything that a media company would need from printing presses to transmitters
what is most important is we do it either in form of loans equities lease whatever is appropriate for you know supporting anybody
but what is most important here is who do we finance
we believe that in the last 10 years companies that we 've financed are actually the best media companies in the developing world
that is a who is who list
and i could spend hours talking about them because they 're all kind of heroes
and i can but i 'll give you just maybe one and depending on time i may give you two examples who we work with
you see we started working in eastern and central europe and moved to russia
our first loan in russia was in chelyabinsk
i 'll bet half of you have never heard of that place
in the south of russia there 's a guy called boris nikolayevich kirshin who is running an independent newspaper there
the city was closed until early 90s because of all things they were producing glass for tupolev planes
anyway he 's running independent newspaper there
after two years working with us he becomes the most respected newspaper in that small place
governor comes to him one day actually invites him to come to his office
he goes and sees the governor the governor says boris nikolayevich i understand you are doing a great job and you are the most respected newspaper in our district
and i want to offer you a deal
can you please give me your newspaper for the next nine months because i have elections there are elections coming up in nine months
i will not run but it 's very important for me who is going to succeed me
so give me the paper for nine months i 'll give it back to you
i have no interest in being in media business
how much would that cost
boris nikolayevich says it 's not for sale
the governor says we will close you
boris nikolayevich says no you cannot do it
six months later the newspaper was closed
luckily we had enough time to help boris nikolayevich take all the assets out of that company and bring him into a new one to get all the subscription lists rehire staff
so what the governor got was an empty shell
but that is what happens if you 're in business of independent media and if you are a banker for independent media
so it sounds like a great story
somewhere down the road we opened a media management center
we started our media lab sounds like a real great story
but there is a second angle to that
the second angle like in this clip
if you take the camera above you start thinking about these numbers again
40 million dollars over 10 years spread over 17 countries
that is not too much is it
it 's actually just a drop in the sea
because when you think about the importance some of the issues that we were talking about last night this last session we had about africa and his hypothetical 50 billion dollars destined for africa
all of those not all half of those problems mentioned last night government accountability corruption how do you fight corruption giving voice to unheard to poor it 's why independent media is in business
and it 's why it was invented
so from that perspective what we did is just really one drop in the sea of that need that we can identify
now ours is just one story
i 'm sure that in this room there are like 15 other wonderful stories of nonprofits doing spectacular work
here is where the problem is and i 'll explain to you as well as i can what the problem is
and it 's called fundraising
imagine that this third of this room is filled with people who represent different foundations
imagine two thirds over here running excellent organizations doing very important work
now imagine that every second person over here is deaf does not hear and switch the lights off
now that is how difficult it is to match people from this side of the room with people of that side of the room
so we thought that some kind of a big idea is needed to reform to totally rethink fundraising
you know instead of people running in this dark trying to find their own match who will be willing who has the same goals
instead of all of that we thought there is something new needs to be invented
and we came up with this idea of issuing bonds press freedom bonds
if there are investors willing to finance u.s. government budget deficit why wouldn 't we find investors willing to finance press freedom deficit
we 've decided to do it this fall we will issue them probably in denominations of 1,000 dollars
i don 't want to advertise them too much that 's not the point
but the point is if we ever survive to actually issue them find enough investors that this can be considered a success there 's nothing stopping the next organization to start to issue bonds next spring
and those can be environmental bonds
and then two weeks later iqbal quadir can issue his electricity in bangladesh bonds
and before you know it any social cause can be actually financed in this way
now we do daydreaming in 11 30 with 55 seconds left
but let 's take the idea further
you do it you start it in the states because it 's you know concepts are very very close to american minds
but you can actually bring it to europe too
you can bring it to asia
you can once you have all of those different points you can make it easy for investors
put all of those bonds at one place and they sit down and click
once you have more than 10 of them you have to develop some kind of a matrix
what do investors get
on one side financial on the other side social
so that brings the idea of some kind of rating agency morningstar type
it says you know social impact over here is spectacular five stars
financial they give you one percent only one star
now take it to the last step
once you have all of that put together there 's not one reason why you couldn 't actually have a marketplace for all of that where you cannot dispose of all of those bonds in a pretty quick way
and in that way you organize the financing so there are no dark rooms no blind people running around to find each other
thank you
so i really consider myself a storyteller
but i don 't really tell stories in the usual way in the sense that i don 't usually tell my own stories
instead i 'm really interested in building tools that allow large numbers of other people to tell their stories people all around the world
i do this because i think that people actually have a lot in common
i think people are very similar but i also think that we have trouble seeing that
you know as i look around the world i see a lot of gaps and i think we all see a lot of gaps
and we define ourselves by our gaps
there 's language gaps there 's ethnicity and racial gaps there 's age gaps there 's gender gaps there 's sexuality gaps there 's wealth and money gaps there 's education gaps there 's also religious gaps
you know we have all these gaps and i think we like our gaps because they make us feel like we identify with something some smaller community
but i think that actually despite our gaps we really have a lot in common
and i think one thing we have in common is a very deep need to express ourselves
i think this is a very old human desire it 's nothing new
but the thing about self-expression is that there 's traditionally been this imbalance between the desire that we have to express ourselves and the number of sympathetic friends who are willing to stand around and listen
this also is nothing new
since the dawn of human history we 've tried to rectify this imbalance by making art writing poems singing songs scripting editorials and sending them in to a newspaper gossiping with friends this is nothing new
what 's new is that in the last several years a lot of these very traditional physical human activities these acts of self-expression have been moving onto the internet
and as that 's happened people have been leaving behind footprints footprints that tell stories of their moments of self-expression
and so what i do is i write computer programs that study very large sets of these footprints and then try to draw conclusions about the people who left them what they feel what they think what 's different in the world today than usual these sorts of questions
one project that explores these ideas which was made about a year ago is a piece called we feel fine
this is a piece that every two or three minutes scans the world 's newly-posted blog entries for occurrences of the phrases i feel or i am feeling
and when it finds one of those phrases it grabs the sentence up to the period and then automatically tries to deduce the age gender and geographical location of the person that wrote that sentence
then knowing the geographical location and the time we can also then figure out the weather when that person wrote the sentence
all of this information is saved in a database that collects about 20,000 feelings a day
it 's been running for about a year and a half
it 's reached about seven-and-a-half million human feelings now
and i 'll show you a glimpse of how this information is then visualized so this is we feel fine
what you see here is a madly swarming mass of particles each of which represents a single human feeling that was stated in the last few hours
the color of each particle corresponds to the type of feeling inside so that happy positive feelings are brightly colored
and sad negative feelings are darkly colored
the diameter of each dot represents the length of the sentence inside so that the large dots contain large sentences and the small dots contain small sentences
any dot can be clicked and expanded and we see here i would just feel so much better if i could curl up in his arms right now and feel his affection for me in the embrace of his body and the tenderness of his lips
so it gets pretty hot and steamy sometimes in the world of human emotions
and all of these are stated by people i know that objectively it really doesn 't mean much but after spending so many years as a small fish in a big pond it 's nice to feel bigger again
the dots exhibit human qualities they kind of have their own physics and they swarm wildly around kind of exploring the world of life
and then they also exhibit curiosity
you can see a few of them are swarming around the cursor right now
you can see some other ones are swarming around the bottom left corner of the screen around six words those six words represent the six movements of we feel fine we 're currently seeing madness
there 's also murmurs montage mobs metrics and mounds
and i 'll walk you through a few of those now
murmurs causes all of the feelings to fly to the ceiling
and then one by one in reverse chronological order they excuse themselves entering the scrolling list of feelings
i feel a bit better now
i feel confused and unsure of what the hell i want to do
i feel gypped out of something awesome here
i feel so free i feel so good
i feel like i 'm in this fog of depression that i can 't get out of
and you can click any of these to go out and visit the blog from which it was collected and in that way you can connect with the authors of these statements if you feel some degree of empathy
the next movement is called montage
montage causes all of the feelings that contain photographs to become extracted and display themselves in a grid
this grid is then said to represent the picture of the world 's feelings in the last few hours if you will
each of these can be clicked and we can blow it up
we see i just feel like i 'm not going to have fun if it 's not the both of us that was from someone in michigan
we see i feel like i have been at a computer all day
these are automatically constructed using the found objects i think i feel a little full
the next movement is called mobs
mobs provides different statistical breakdowns of the population of the world 's feelings in the last few hours
we see that better is the most frequent feeling right now followed by good bad guilty right down sick and so on
we can also get a gender breakdown
and we see that women are slightly more prolific talking about their emotions in the last few hours than men
we can do an age breakdown which gives us a histogram of the world 's emotional distribution by age
we see people in their twenties are the most prolific followed by teenagers and then people in their thirties and it dies out very quickly from there
in weather the feelings assume the physical characteristics of the weather that they represent so that the ones collected on a sunny day swirl around as if they 're part of the sun
the cloudy ones float along as if they 're on a breeze
the rainy ones fall down as if they 're in a rainstorm and the snowy ones kind of flutter to the ground
finally location causes the feelings to move to their positions on a world map showing the geographical distribution of feelings
metrics provides more numerical views on the data
we see that the world is feeling used at 3.3 times the normal level right now
they 're feeling warm at 2.9 times the normal level and so on
other views are also available
here are gender age weather location
the final movement is called mounds
it 's a bit different from the others
mounds visualizes the entire dataset as large gelatinous blobs which kind of jiggle
and if i hold down my cursor they do a little dance
we see better is the most frequent feeling followed by bad
and then if i go over here the list begins to scroll and there are actually thousands of feelings that have been collected
you can see the little pink cursor moving along representing our position
here we see people that feel slipping nauseous responsible
there 's also a search capability if you 're interested in finding out about a certain population
for instance you could find women who feel addicted in their 20s when it was cloudy in bangladesh
but i 'll spare you that
so here are some of my favorite montages that have been collected i feel so much of my dad alive in me that there isn 't even room for me
i feel very lonely
i need to be in some backwoods redneck town so that i can feel beautiful
i feel invisible to you
i wouldn 't hide it if society didn 't make me feel like i needed to
i feel in love with carolyn i feel so naughty
i feel these weirdoes are actually an asset to college life
i love how i feel today
so as you can see we feel fine uses a technique that i call passive observation
what i mean by that is that it passively observes people as they live their lives it scans the world 's blogs and looks at what people are writing and these people don 't know they 're being watched or interviewed
and because of that you end up getting very honest candid sincere responses that are often very moving
and this is a technique that i usually prefer in my work because people don 't know they 're being interviewed
they 're just living life and they end up just acting like that
another technique is directly questioning people
and this is a technique that i explored in a different project the yahoo time capsule which was designed to take a fingerprint of the world in 2006
it was divided into ten very simple themes love anger sadness and so on each of which contained a single very open-ended question put to the world what do you love what makes you angry
what makes you sad what do you believe in and so on
the time capsule was available for one month online translated into 10 languages and this is what it looked like
it 's a spinning globe the surface of which is entirely composed of the pictures and words and drawings of people that submitted to the time capsule
the ten themes radiate out and orbit the time capsule
you can sift through this data and see what people have submitted
this is in response to what 's beautiful miss world
there are two modes to the time capsule
there 's one world which presents the spinning globe and many voices which splits the data out into film strips and lets you sift through them one by one
so this project was punctuated by a really amazing event which was held in the desert outside albuquerque in new mexico at the jemez pueblo where for three consecutive nights the contents of the capsule were projected onto the sides of the ancient red rock canyon walls which stand about 200 feet tall it was really incredible
and we also projected the contents of the time capsule as binary code using a 35-watt laser into outer space
you can see the orange line leaving the desert floor at about a 45 degree angle there this was amazing because the first night i looked at all this information and really started seeing the gaps that i talked about earlier the differences in age gender and wealth and so on
but you know as i looked at this more and more and more and saw these images go across the rocks i realized i was seeing the same archetypal events depicted again and again and again
you know weddings births funerals the first car the first kiss the first camel or horse depending on the culture
and it was really moving and this picture here was taken the final night from a distant cliff about two miles away where the contents of the capsule were being beamed into space
and there was something very moving about all of this human expression being shot off into the night sky
and it started to make me think a lot about the night sky and how humans have always used the night sky to project their great stories
you know as a child in vermont on a farm where i grew up i would often look up into the dark sky and see the three star belt of orion the hunter
and as an adult i 've been more aware of the great greek myths playing out in the sky overhead every night
you know orion facing the roaring bull
perseus flying to the rescue of andromeda
zeus battling chronos for control of mount olympus
i mean these are the great tales of the greeks
and it caused me to wonder about our world today
and it caused me to wonder specifically if we could make new constellations today what would those look like what would those be
if we could make new pictures in the sky what would we draw
what are the great stories of today
and those are the questions that inspired my new project which is debuting here today at ted
nobody 's seen this yet publicly
it 's called universe revealing our modern mythology
and it uses this metaphor of an interactive night sky
so it 's my great pleasure now to show this to you
so universe will open here
and you 'll see that it leads with a shifting star field and there 's an aurora borealis in the background kind of morphing with color the color of the aurora borealis can be controlled using this single bar of color at the bottom and we 'll put it down here to red
so you see this kind of these stars moving along
now these aren 't just little points of light little pixels
each of those stars actually represents a specific event in the real world a quote that was stated by somebody an image a news story a person a company you know some kind of heroic personality
and you might notice that as the cursor begins to touch some of these stars that shapes begin to emerge
we see here there 's a little man walking along or maybe a woman
and we see here a photograph with a head
you can start to see words emerging here
and those are the constellations of today
and i can turn them all on and you can see them moving across the sky now
this is the universe of 2007 the last two months
the data from this is global news coverage from thousands of news sources around the world
it 's using the api of a really great company that i work with in new york actually called daylife
and it 's kind of the zeitgeist view at this level of the world 's current mythology over the last couple of months
so we can see where it 's emerging here like president ford iraq bush and we can actually isolate just the words i call them secrets and we can cause them to form an alphabetical list and we see anna nicole smith playing a big role recently
president ford this is gerald ford 's funeral
we can actually click anything in universe and have it become the center of the universe and everything else will enter its orbit
so we 'll click ford and now that becomes the center
and the things that relate to ford enter its orbit and swirl around it
we can isolate just the photographs and we now see those
we can click on one of those and have the photograph be the center of the universe
now the things that relate to it are swirling around
we can click on this and we see this iconic image of betty ford kissing her husband 's coffin
in universe there 's kind of no end it just goes infinitely and you can just kind of click on stuff
this is a photographic representation called snapshots
but we can actually be more specific in defining our universe
so if we want to let 's check out what bill clinton 's universe looks like
and let 's see in the past week what he 's been up to
so now we have a new universe which is just constrained to all things bill clinton
we can have his constellations emerge here
we can pull out his secrets and we see that it has a lot to do with candidates hillary presidential barack obama
we can see the stories that bill clinton is taking part in right now
any of those can be opened up
so we see obama and the clintons meet in alabama
you can see that this is an important story there are a lot of things in its orbit if we open this up we get different perspectives on this story
you can click any of those to go out and read the article at the source this one 's from al jazeera
we can also see the superstars these would be the people that are kind of the looming heroes and heroines in the universe of bill clinton so there 's bill clinton hillary iraq george bush barack obama scooter libby these are kind of the people of bill clinton
we can also see a world map so this shows us the geographic reach of bill clinton in the last week or so
we can see he 's been focused in america because he 's been campaigning probably but a little bit of action over here in the middle east
and then we can also see a timeline
so we see that he was a bit quiet on saturday but he was back to work on sunday morning and actually been tapering off since then this week
and it 's not limited to just people or dates but we can actually put in concepts also
so if i put in climate change for all of 2006 we 'll see what that universe looks like
here we have our star field here we have our shapes
here we have our secrets
so we see again climate change is large nairobi global conference environmental
and there are also quotes that you can see if you 're interested in reading about quotes on climate change
you know this is really an infinite thing
the superstars of climate change in 2006 united states britain china you know these are the towering countries that kind of define this concept
so this is a piece that demands exploration
this will be online in several days probably next tuesday
and you 'll all be able to use it and kind of explore what your own personal mythology might be
you 'll notice that in daylife rather in universe it supports both the notion of a global mythology which is represented by something as broad as say 2007 and also a personal mythology
as you search for the things that are important to you in your world and then see what the constellations of those might look like
so it 's been a pleasure thank you very much

i 'm here to enlist you in helping reshape the story about how humans and other critters get things done
here is the old story we 've already heard a little bit about it biology is war in which only the fiercest survive businesses and nations succeed only by defeating destroying and dominating competition politics is about your side winning at all costs
but i think we can see the very beginnings of a new story beginning to emerge
it 's a narrative spread across a number of different disciplines in which cooperation collective action and complex interdependencies play a more important role
and the central but not all-important role of competition and survival of the fittest shrinks just a little bit to make room
i started thinking about the relationship between communication media and collective action when i wrote smart mobs and i found that when i finished the book i kept thinking about it
in fact if you look back human communication media and the ways in which we organize socially have been co-evolving for quite a long time
humans have lived for much much longer than the approximately 10,000 years of settled agricultural civilization in small family groups nomadic hunters bring down rabbits gathering food
the form of wealth in those days was enough food to stay alive
but at some point they banded together to hunt bigger game
and we don 't know exactly how they did this although they must have solved some collective action problems it only makes sense that you can 't hunt mastodons while you 're fighting with the other groups
and again we have no way of knowing but it 's clear that a new form of wealth must have emerged
more protein than a hunter 's family could eat before it rotted
so that raised a social question that i believe must have driven new social forms
did the people who ate that mastodon meat owe something to the hunters and their families
and if so how did they make arrangements
again we can 't know but we can be pretty sure that some form of symbolic communication must have been involved
of course with agriculture came the first big civilizations the first cities built of mud and brick the first empires
and it was the administers of these empires who began hiring people to keep track of the wheat and sheep and wine that was owed and the taxes that was owed on them by making marks marks on clay in that time
not too much longer after that the alphabet was invented
and this powerful tool was really reserved for thousands of years for the elite administrators who kept track of accounts for the empires
and then another communication technology enabled new media the printing press came along and within decades millions of people became literate
and from literate populations new forms of collective action emerged in the spheres of knowledge religion and politics
we saw scientific revolutions the protestant reformation constitutional democracies possible where they had not been possible before
not created by the printing press but enabled by the collective action that emerges from literacy
and again new forms of wealth emerged
now commerce is ancient markets are as old as the crossroads
but capitalism as we know it is only a few hundred years old enabled by cooperative arrangements and technologies such as the joint-stock ownership company shared liability insurance double-entry bookkeeping
now of course the enabling technologies are based on the internet and in the many-to-many era every desktop is now a printing press a broadcasting station a community or a marketplace
evolution is speeding up
more recently that power is untethering and leaping off the desktops and very very quickly we 're going to see a significant proportion if not the majority of the human race walking around holding carrying or wearing supercomputers linked at speeds greater than what we consider to be broadband today
now when i started looking into collective action the considerable literature on it is based on what sociologists call social dilemmas
and there are a couple of mythic narratives of social dilemmas
i 'm going to talk briefly about two of them the prisoner 's dilemma and the tragedy of the commons
now when i talked about this with kevin kelly he assured me that everybody in this audience pretty much knows the details of the prisoner 's dilemma so i 'm just going to go over that very very quickly
if you have more questions about it ask kevin kelly later
the prisoner 's dilemma is actually a story that 's overlaid on a mathematical matrix that came out of the game theory in the early years of thinking about nuclear war two players who couldn 't trust each other
let me just say that every unsecured transaction is a good example of a prisoner 's dilemma
person with the goods person with the money because they can 't trust each other are not going to exchange
neither one wants to be the first one or they 're going to get the sucker 's payoff but both lose of course because they don 't get what they want
if they could only agree if they could only turn a prisoner 's dilemma into a different payoff matrix called an assurance game they could proceed
twenty years ago robert axelrod used the prisoner 's dilemma as a probe of the biological question if we are here because our ancestors were such fierce competitors how does cooperation exist at all
he started a computer tournament for people to submit prisoner 's dilemma strategies and discovered much to his surprise that a very very simple strategy won it won the first tournament and even after everyone knew it won it won the second tournament that 's known as tit for tat
another economic game that may not be as well known as the prisoner 's dilemma is the ultimatum game and it 's also a very interesting probe of our assumptions about the way people make economic transactions
here 's how the game is played there are two players they 've never played the game before they will not play the game again they don 't know each other and they are in fact in separate rooms
first player is offered a hundred dollars and is asked to propose a split 50 50 90 10 whatever that player wants to propose the second player either accepts the split both players are paid and the game is over or rejects the split neither player is paid and the game is over
now the fundamental basis of neoclassical economics would tell you it 's irrational to reject a dollar because someone you don 't know in another room is going to get 99
yet in thousands of trials with american and european and japanese students a significant percentage would reject any offer that 's not close to 50 50
and although they were screened and didn 't know about the game and had never played the game before proposers seemed to innately know this because the average proposal was surprisingly close to 50 50
now the interesting part comes in more recently when anthropologists began taking this game to other cultures and discovered to their surprise that slash-and-burn agriculturalists in the amazon or nomadic pastoralists in central asia or a dozen different cultures each had radically different ideas of what is fair
which suggests that instead of there being an innate sense of fairness that somehow the basis of our economic transactions can be influenced by our social institutions whether we know that or not
the other major narrative of social dilemmas is the tragedy of the commons
garrett hardin used it to talk about overpopulation in the late 1960s
he used the example of a common grazing area in which each person by simply maximizing their own flock led to overgrazing and the depletion of the resource
he had the rather gloomy conclusion that humans will inevitably despoil any common pool resource in which people cannot be restrained from using it
now elinor ostrom a political scientist in 1990 asked the interesting question that any good scientist should ask which is is it really true that humans will always despoil commons
so she went out and looked at what data she could find
she looked at thousands of cases of humans sharing watersheds forestry resources fisheries and discovered that yes in case after case humans destroyed the commons that they depended on
but she also found many instances in which people escaped the prisoner 's dilemma in fact the tragedy of the commons is a multiplayer prisoner 's dilemma
and she said that people are only prisoners if they consider themselves to be
they escape by creating institutions for collective action
and she discovered i think most interestingly that among those institutions that worked there were a number of common design principles and those principles seem to be missing from those institutions that don 't work
i 'm moving very quickly over a number of disciplines in biology the notions of symbiosis group selection evolutionary psychology are contested to be sure
but there is really no longer any major debate over the fact that cooperative arrangements have moved from a peripheral role to a central role in biology from the level of the cell to the level of the ecology
and again our notions of individuals as economic beings have been overturned
rational self-interest is not always the dominating factor
in fact people will act to punish cheaters even at a cost to themselves
and most recently neurophysiological measures have shown that people who punish cheaters in economic games show activity in the reward centers of their brain
which led one scientist to declare that altruistic punishment may be the glue that holds societies together
now i 've been talking about how new forms of communication and new media in the past have helped create new economic forms
commerce is ancient markets are very old capitalism is fairly recent socialism emerged as a reaction to that
and yet we see very little talk about how the next form may be emerging
jim surowiecki briefly mentioned yochai benkler 's paper about open source pointing to a new form of production peer-to-peer production
i simply want you to keep in mind that if in the past new forms of cooperation enabled by new technologies create new forms of wealth we may be moving into yet another economic form that is significantly different from previous ones
very briefly let 's look at some businesses ibm as you know hp sun some of the most fierce competitors in the it world are open sourcing their software are providing portfolios of patents for the commons
eli lilly in again the fiercely competitive pharmaceutical world has created a market for solutions for pharmaceutical problems
toyota instead of treating its suppliers as a marketplace treats them as a network and trains them to produce better even though they are also training them to produce better for their competitors
now none of these companies are doing this out of altruism they 're doing it because they 're learning that a certain kind of sharing is in their self-interest
open source production has shown us that world-class software like linux and mozilla can be created with neither the bureaucratic structure of the firm nor the incentives of the marketplace as we 've known them
google enriches itself by enriching thousands of bloggers through adsense
amazon has opened its application programming interface to 60,000 developers countless amazon shops
they 're enriching others not out of altruism but as a way of enriching themselves
ebay solved the prisoner 's dilemma and created a market where none would have existed by creating a feedback mechanism that turns a prisoner 's dilemma game into an assurance game
instead of neither of us can trust each other so we have to make suboptimal moves it 's you prove to me that you are trustworthy and i will cooperate
wikipedia has used thousands of volunteers to create a free encyclopedia with a million and a half articles in 200 languages in just a couple of years
we 've seen that thinkcycle has enabled ngos in developing countries to put up problems to be solved by design students around the world including something that 's being used for tsunami relief right now it 's a mechanism for rehydrating cholera victims that 's so simple to use it illiterates can be trained to use it
bittorrent turns every downloader into an uploader making the system more efficient the more it is used
millions of people have contributed their desktop computers when they 're not using them to link together through the internet into supercomputing collectives that help solve the protein folding problem for medical researchers that 's folding @ home at stanford to crack codes to search for life in outer space
i don 't think we know enough yet
i don 't think we 've even begun to discover what the basic principles are but i think we can begin to think about them
and i don 't have enough time to talk about all of them but think about self-interest
this is all about self-interest that adds up to more
in el salvador both sides that withdrew from their civil war took moves that had been proven to mirror a prisoner 's dilemma strategy
in the u.s. in the philippines in kenya around the world citizens have self-organized political protests and get out the vote campaigns using mobile devices and sms
is an apollo project of cooperation possible
a transdisciplinary study of cooperation
i believe that the payoff would be very big
i think we need to begin developing maps of this territory so that we can talk about it across disciplines
and i am not saying that understanding cooperation is going to cause us to be better people and sometimes people cooperate to do bad things but i will remind you that a few hundred years ago people saw their loved ones die from diseases they thought were caused by sin or foreigners or evil spirits
descartes said we need an entire new way of thinking
when the scientific method provided that new way of thinking and biology showed that microorganisms caused disease suffering was alleviated
what forms of suffering could be alleviated what forms of wealth could be created if we knew a little bit more about cooperation
i don 't think that this transdisciplinary discourse is automatically going to happen it 's going to require effort
so i enlist you to help me get the cooperation project started
thank you
good afternoon i am proud to be here at tedxkrakow
i 'll try to speak a little bit today about a phenomenon which can and is actually changing the world and whose name is people power
i 'll start with the anecdote or for those of you who are monty python lovers a monty python type of sketch
here it is it is december 15 2010
somebody gives you a bet you will look at a crystal ball and you will see the future the future will be accurate
but you need to share it with the world okay
curiosity killed the cat you take the bet
you look at the crystal ball one hour later you are sitting in a building on the national tv in a talkshow and you tell the story
before the end of 2011 ben ali and mubarak and gaddafi will be down and prosecuted
saleh of yemen and assad of syria would be either challenged or already on their knees
osama bin laden will be dead and ratko mladic will be in the hague
now the anchor watches you with a strange gaze on his face and then on the top of it you add and thousands of the young people from athens madrid and new york will demonstrate for social justice claiming that they are inspired with arabs
next thing you know two guys in white appear
they give you the strange t-shirt take you to the nearest mental institution
so i would like to speak a little bit about the phenomenon which is behind what already seems to be the very bad year for bad guys and this phenomenon is called people power
well people power has been there for a while
it helped gandhi kick the brits from india
it helped martin luther king win a historic racial struggle
it helped local lech walesa to kick out one million soviet troops from poland and beginning the end of the soviet union as we know it
so what 's new in it what seems to be very new which is the idea i would like to share with you today that there is a set of rules and skills which can be learned and taught in order to perform successful nonviolent struggle
if this is true we can help these movements
well first one analytic skills
i 'll try where it all started in the middle east and for so many years we were living with completely the wrong perception of the middle east
it was looking like the frozen region literally a refrigerator and there are only two types of meals there steak which stands for a mubarak ben ali-type of military police dictatorship or a potato which stands for tehran types of theocracies
and everybody was amazed when the refrigerator opened and millions of young mainly secular people step out to do the change guess what they didn 't watch the demographics
what is the average age of egyptians 24
how long was mubarak in power 31
so this system just obsolete they expired and young people of the arab world have awakened one morning and understood that power lies in their hands
the rest is the year in front of us and guess what
the same generation epsilon with their rules with their tools with their games and with their language which sounds a little bit strange to me i am 38 now
and can you look at the age of the people on the streets of europe
it seems that generation epsilon is coming
now let me set another example
i 'm meeting different people throughout the world and they are you know academics and professors and doctors and they will always talk conditions
they will say people power will work only if the regime is not too oppressive
they will say people power will work if the annual income of the country is between x and z .
they will say people power will work only if there is a foreign pressure
they will say people power will work only if there is no oil
and i mean there is a set of conditions
well the news here is that your skills [ that you ] bring in the conflict seem to be more important than the conditions namely skills of unity planning and maintaining nonviolent discipline
let me give you the example
i am coming from a country called serbia
it took us 10 years to unite 18 opposition party leaders with their big egos behind one single candidate against balkan dictator slobodan milosevic
guess what that was the day of his defeat
you look at the egyptians they fire on tahrir square they get rid of their individual symbols
they appear on the street only with the flag of egypt
i will give you a counter-example
you see nine presidential candidates running against lukashenko
you will know the outcome
so unity is a big thing and this can be achieved
same with planning somebody has lied to you about the successful and spontaneous nonviolent revolution
that thing doesn 't exist in the world
whenever you see young people in front of the road trying to fraternize with the police or military somebody was thinking about it before
now at the end nonviolent discipline and this is probably the game-changer
if you maintain nonviolent discipline you will exclusively win
you have 100,000 people in a nonviolent march and one idiot or agent provocateur is throwing stones guess what takes all the cameras that one guy
one single act of violence can literally destroy your movement
now let me move to another place
it 's selection of strategies and tactics
there are certain rules in nonviolent struggle you may follow
first you start small
second you pick the battles you can win
it 's only 200 of us in this room
we won 't call for the march of millions
but what if we organize spraying graffiti throughout the night all over krakow city the city will know
so we pick the tactics which accommodates to the event especially this thing we call the small tactics of dispersion
they 're very useful in a violent oppression
we are actually witnessing the picture of one of the best tactics ever used
it was on tahrir square where the international community was constantly frightened that the islamists will overtake the revolution well they 've organized christians protecting muslims who are there praying coptic wedding cheered by thousands of muslims
the world has just changed the picture but somebody was thinking about this previously
so there are so many things you can do instead of getting into one place shouting and showing off in front of the security forces
now there is also another very important dynamic and this is a dynamic normally analytics don 't see
this is dynamics between fear and apathy on one side and enthusiasm and humor on another side
so it works like in a video game
you have a fear high you have status quo
you have enthusiasm higher you see fear starting to melt
day two you see people running towards police instead of from the police
in egypt you can tell that something is happening there
and then it 's about humor humor is such a powerful game-changer and of course it was very big in poland
and you know we were just a small group of crazy students in serbia when we made this big skit
we put the big petrol barrel with a portrait picture of mr. president on it in the middle of the main street there was a hole on the top so you could literally come put a coin in get a baseball bat and pow hit his face
sounds loud and within the minutes we were sitting in a nearby cafe having coffee and there was a queue of people waiting to do this lovely thing
well that 's just the beginning of the show
the real show starts when the police appears
what will they do arrest us we are nowhere to be seen
we are three blocks away observing it from our espresso bar
arrest the shoppers with kids doesn 't make sense
of course you could bet they have done the most stupid thing they arrested the barrel and now the picture of the smashed face on the barrel with the policeman dragging them to the police car that was the best day for the photographers from newspapers that they ever will have
so i mean these are the things you can do and you can always use the humor
there is also one big thing about the humor it really hurts because these guys really are taking themselves too seriously
when you start to mock them it hurts
now everybody is talking about his majesty the internet and it is also a very useful skill but don 't rush to label things like facebook revolution twitter revolution
don 't mix tools with the substance
it is true that the internet and new media are very useful in making things faster and cheaper
they make it also a bit safer for the participants because they give the part of anonymity
we are watching the great example of something else the internet can do
it can put the price tag of state-sponsored violence over nonviolent protesters
this is a famous group we are all khaled said made by wael ghonim in egypt and his friend
this is the mutilated face of the guy who was beaten by the police
this is how he became the public and this is what probably became the straw which broke the camel 's back
but here is also the bad news
the nonviolent struggle is won in the real world in the streets you will never change your society towards democracy or economics if you sit down and click
there are risks to be taken and there are living people who are winning the struggle
well million dollar question what will happen in the arab world
and though young people from the arab world were pretty successful in bringing down three dictators shaking the region kind of persuading clever kings from jordan and morocco doing substantial reforms it is yet to be seen what will be the outcome whether the egyptians and tunisians will make it through the transition or this will end in bloody ethnic and religious conflict whether the syrians will maintain nonviolent discipline faced with the brutal daily violence which kills thousands already or they will slip into violent struggle and make ugly civil war
will these revolutions be whole like through the transitions to democracy or be overtaken by military or extremists of all kinds we cannot tell
same works for the western sector where you can see all of these excited young people protesting around the world occupying this occupying that
are they going to become the world wave
are they going to find their skills their enthusiasm and their strategy to find what they really want and push for the reform or will they just stay complaining about the endless list of the things they hate
this is the difference between two towns
now what [ do ] the statistics have
my friend 's book maria stephan 's book talks a lot about violent and nonviolent struggle and there are some shocking data
if you look at the last 35 years and different social transitions from dictatorship to democracy you will see that out of 67 different cases in 50 of these cases it was nonviolent struggle which was the key power
this is one more reason to look at this phenomenon
this is one more reason to look at the generation epsilon enough for me to give them credit and hope that they will find their skills and their courage to use the nonviolent struggle and thus fix at least a part of the mess our generation is making in this world
thank you
can i say how delighted i am to be away from the calm of westminster and whitehall
this is kim a nine-year-old vietnam girl her back ruined by napalm and she awakened the conscience of the nation of america to begin to end the vietnam war
this is birhan who was the ethiopian girl who launched live aid in the 1980s 15 minutes away from death when she was rescued and that picture of her being rescued is one that went round the world
this is tiananmen square
a man before a tank became a picture that became a symbol for the whole world of resistance
this next is the sudanese girl a few moments from death a vulture hovering in the background a picture that went round the world and shocked people into action on poverty
this is neda the iranian girl who was shot while at a demonstration with her father in iran only a few weeks ago and she is now the focus rightly so of the youtube generation
and what do all these pictures and events have in common
what they have in common is what we see unlocks what we cannot see
what we see unlocks the invisible ties and bonds of sympathy that bring us together to become a human community
what these pictures demonstrate is that we do feel the pain of others however distantly
what i think these pictures demonstrate is that we do believe in something bigger than ourselves
what these pictures demonstrate is that there is a moral sense across all religions across all faiths across all continents a moral sense that not only do we share the pain of others and believe in something bigger than ourselves but we have a duty to act when we see things that are wrong that need righted see injuries that need to be corrected see problems that need to be rectified
there is a story about olof palme the swedish prime minister going to see ronald reagan in america in the 1980s
before he arrived ronald reagan said and he was the swedish social democratic prime minister isn 't this man a communist
the reply was no mr president he 's an anti-communist
and ronald reagan said i don 't care what kind of communist he is
ronald reagan asked olof palme the social democratic prime minister of sweden well what do you believe in do you want to abolish the rich
he said no i want to abolish the poor
our responsibility is to let everyone have the chance to realize their potential to the full
i believe there is a moral sense and a global ethic that commands attention from people of every religion and every faith and people of no faith
but i think what 's new is that we now have the capacity to communicate instantaneously across frontiers right across the world
we now have the capacity to find common ground with people who we will never meet but who we will meet through the internet and through all the modern means of communication that we now have the capacity to organize and take collective action together to deal with the problem or an injustice that we want to deal with and i believe that this makes this a unique age in human history and it is the start of what i would call the creation of a truly global society
go back 200 years when the slave trade was under pressure from william wilberforce and all the protesters
they protested across britain
they won public opinion over a long period of time
but it took 24 years for the campaign to be successful
what could they have done with the pictures that they could have shown if they were able to use the modern means of communication to win people 's hearts and minds
or if you take eglantyne jebb the woman who created save the children 90 years ago
she was so appalled by what was happening in austria as a result of the first world war and what was happening to children who were part of the defeated families of austria that in britain she wanted to take action but she had to go house to house leaflet to leaflet to get people to attend a rally in the royal albert hall that eventually gave birth to save the children an international organization that is now fully recognized as one of the great institutions in our land and in the world
but what more could she have done if she 'd had the modern means of communications available to her to create a sense that the injustice that people saw had to be acted upon immediately
now look at what 's happened in the last 10 years
in philippines in 2001 president estrada a million people texted each other about the corruption of that regime eventually brought it down and it was of course called the coup de text
then you have in zimbabwe the first election under robert mugabe a year ago
because people were able to take mobile phone photographs of what was happening at the polling stations it was impossible for that premier to fix that election in the way that he wanted to do
or take burma and the monks that were blogging out a country that nobody knew anything about that was happening until these blogs told the world that there was a repression meaning that lives were being lost and people were being persecuted and aung san suu kyi who is one of the great prisoners of conscience of the world had to be listened to
then take iran itself and what people are doing today following what happened to neda people who are preventing the security services of iran finding those people who are blogging out of iran any by everybody who is blogging changing their address to tehran iran and making it difficult for the security services
take therefore what modern technology is capable of the power of our moral sense allied to the power of communications and our ability to organize internationally
that in my view gives us the first opportunity as a community to fundamentally change the world
foreign policy can never be the same again it cannot be run by elites it 's got to be run by listening to the public opinions of peoples who are blogging who are communicating with each other around the world
200 years ago the problem we had to solve was slavery
150 years ago i suppose the main problem in a country like ours was how young people children had the right to education
100 years ago in most countries in europe the pressure was for the right to vote
50 years ago the pressure was for the right to social security and welfare
in the last 50-60 years we have seen fascism anti-semitism racism apartheid discrimination on the basis of sex and gender and sexuality all these have come under pressure because of the campaigns that have been run by people to change the world
i was with nelson mandela a year ago when he was in london
i was at a concert that he was attending to mark his birthday and for the creation of new resources for his foundation
i was sitting next to nelson mandela i was very privileged to do so when amy winehouse came onto the stage
and nelson mandela was quite surprised at the appearance of the singer and i was explaining to him at the time who she was
amy winehouse said nelson mandela and i have a lot in common
my husband too has spent a long time in prison
nelson mandela then went down to the stage and he summarized the challenge for us all
he said in his lifetime he had climbed a great mountain the mountain of challenging and then defeating racial oppression and defeating apartheid
he said that there was a greater challenge ahead the challenge of poverty of climate change global challenges that needed global solutions and needed the creation of a truly global society
we are the first generation which is in a position to do this
combine the power of a global ethic with the power of our ability to communicate and organize globally with the challenges that we now face most of which are global in their nature
climate change cannot be solved in one country but has got to be solved by the world working together
a financial crisis just as we have seen could not be solved by america alone or europe alone it needed the world to work together
take the problems of security and terrorism and equally the problem of human rights and development they cannot be solved by africa alone they cannot be solved by america or europe alone
we cannot solve these problems unless we work together
so the great project of our generation it seems to me is to build for the first time out of a global ethic and our global ability to communicate and organize together a truly global society built on that ethic but with institutions that can serve that global society and make for a different future
we have now and are the first generation with the power to do this
take climate change is it not absolutely scandalous that we have a situation where we know that there is a climate change problem where we know also that that will mean we have to give more resources to the poorest countries to deal with that when we want to create a global carbon market but there is no global institution that people have been able to agree upon to deal with this problem
one of the things that has got to come out of copenhagen in the next few months is an agreement that there will be a global environmental institution that is able to deal with the problems of persuading the whole of the world to move along a climate-change agenda
one of the reasons why an institution is not in itself enough is that we have got to persuade people around the world to change their behavior as well so you need that global ethic of fairness and responsibility across the generations
take the financial crisis
if people in poorer countries can be hit by a crisis that starts in new york or starts in the sub-prime market of the united states of america
if people can find that that sub-prime product has been transferred across nations many many times until it ends up in banks in iceland or the rest in britain and people 's ordinary savings are affected by it then you cannot rely on a system of national supervision
you need in the long run for stability for economic growth for jobs as well as for financial stability global economic institutions that make sure that growth to be sustained has to be shared and are built on the principle that the prosperity of this world is indivisible
so another challenge for our generation is to create global institutions that reflect our ideas of fairness and responsibility not the ideas that were the basis of the last stage of financial development over these recent years
then take development and take the partnership we need between our countries and the rest of the world the poorest part of the world
we do not have the basis of a proper partnership for the future and yet out of people 's desire for a global ethic and a global society that can be done
i have just been talking to the president of sierra leone
this is a country of six and a half million people but it has only 80 doctors it has 200 nurses it has 120 midwives
you cannot begin to build a healthcare system for six million people with such limited resources
or take the girl i met when i was in tanzania a girl called miriam
she was 11 years old her parents had both died from aids her mother and then her father
she was an aids orphan being handed across different extended families to be cared for
she herself was suffering from hiv she was suffering from tuberculosis
i met her in a field she was ragged she had no shoes
when you looked in her eyes any girl at the age of eleven is looking forward to the future but there was an unreachable sadness in that girl 's eyes and if i could have translated that to the rest of the world for that moment i believe that all the work that it had done for the global hiv aids fund would be rewarded by people being prepared to make donations
we must then build a proper relationship between the richest and the poorest countries based on our desire that they are able to fend for themselves with the investment that is necessary in their agriculture so that africa is not a net importer of food but an exporter of food
take the problems of human rights and the problems of security in so many countries around the world
burma is in chains zimbabwe is a human tragedy in sudan thousands of people have died unnecessarily for wars that we could prevent
in the rwanda children 's museum there is a photograph of a 10-year-old boy and the children 's museum is commemorating the lives that were lost in the rwandan genocide where a million people died
there is a photograph of a boy called david
beside that photograph there is the information about his life
it said david age 10
david ambition to be a doctor
favorite sport football what did he enjoy most
making people laugh
how did he die
tortured to death
last words said to his mother who was also tortured to death don 't worry the united nations are coming
and we never did
and that young boy believed our promises that we would help people in difficulty in rwanda and we never did
so we have got to create in this world also institutions for peacekeeping and humanitarian aid but also for reconstruction and security for some of the conflict-ridden states of the world
so my argument today is basically this
we have the means by which we could create a truly global society
the institutions of this global society can be created by our endeavors
that global ethic can infuse the fairness and responsibility that is necessary for these institutions to work but we should not lose the chance in this generation in this decade in particular with president obama in america with other people working with us around the world to create global institutions for the environment and for finance and for security and for development that make sense of our responsibility to other peoples our desire to bind the world together and our need to tackle problems that everybody knows exist
it is said that in ancient rome that when cicero spoke to his audiences people used to turn to each other and say about cicero great speech
but it is said that in ancient greece when demosthenes spoke to his audiences people turned to each other and didn 't say great speech
they said let 's march
we should be marching towards a global society
thank you
we see with the eyes but we see with the brain as well
and seeing with the brain is often called imagination
and we are familiar with the landscapes of our own imagination our inscapes we 've lived with them all our lives
but there are also hallucinations as well and hallucinations are completely different
they don 't seem to be of our creation
they don 't seem to be under our control
they seem to come from the outside and to mimic perception
so i am going to be talking about hallucinations and a particular sort of visual hallucination which i see among my patients
a few months ago i got a phone call from a nursing home where i work
they told me that one of their residents an old lady in her 90s was seeing things and they wondered if she 'd gone bonkers or because she was an old lady whether she 'd had a stroke or whether she had alzheimer 's
and so they asked me if i would come and see rosalie the old lady
i went in to see her
it was evident straight away that she was perfectly sane and lucid and of good intelligence but she 'd been very startled and very bewildered because she 'd been seeing things
and she told me the nurses hadn 't mentioned this that she was blind that she had been completely blind from macular degeneration for five years
but now for the last few days she 'd been seeing things
so i said what sort of things
and she said people in eastern dress in drapes walking up and down stairs
a man who turns towards me and smiles
but he has huge teeth on one side of his mouth
animals too
i see a white building it 's snowing a soft snow
i see this horse with a harness dragging the snow away
then one night the scene changes
i see cats and dogs walking towards me
they come to a certain point and then stop
then it changes again
i see a lot of children they are walking up and down stairs
they wear bright colors rose and blue like eastern dress
sometimes she said before the people come on she may hallucinate pink and blue squares on the floor which seem to go up to the ceiling
i said is this like a dream
and she said no it 's not like a dream it 's like a movie
she said it 's got color it 's got motion
but it 's completely silent like a silent movie
and she said that it 's a rather boring movie
she said all these people with eastern dress walking up and down very repetitive very limited
and she has a sense of humor
she knew it was a hallucination
but she was frightened she 'd lived 95 years and she 'd never had a hallucination before
she said that the hallucinations were unrelated to anything she was thinking or feeling or doing that they seemed to come on by themselves or disappear
she had no control over them
she said she didn 't recognize any of the people or places in the hallucinations
and none of the people or the animals well they all seemed oblivious of her
and she didn 't know what was going on
she wondered if she was going mad or losing her mind
well i examined her carefully
she was a bright old lady perfectly sane she had no medical problems
she wasn 't on any medications which could produce hallucinations
but she was blind
and i then said to her i think i know what you have
i said there is a special form of visual hallucination which may go with deteriorating vision or blindness
this was originally described i said right back in the 18th century by a man called charles bonnet
and you have charles bonnet syndrome
there is nothing wrong with your brain there is nothing wrong with your mind
you have charles bonnet syndrome
and she was very relieved at this that there was nothing seriously the matter and also rather curious
she said who is this charles bonnet
she said did he have them himself
and she said tell all the nurses that i have charles bonnet syndrome
i 'm not crazy i 'm not demented i have charles bonnet syndrome
well so i did tell the nurses
now this for me is a common situation
i work in old-age homes largely
i see a lot of elderly people who are hearing impaired or visually impaired
about 10 percent of the hearing impaired people get musical hallucinations
and about 10 percent of the visually impaired people get visual hallucinations
you don 't have to be completely blind only sufficiently impaired
now with the original description in the 18th century charles bonnet did not have them
his grandfather had these hallucinations
his grandfather was a magistrate an elderly man
he 'd had cataract surgery
his vision was pretty poor
and in 1759 he described to his grandson various things he was seeing
the first thing he said was he saw a handkerchief in midair
it was a large blue handkerchief with four orange circles
and he knew it was a hallucination
you don 't have handkerchiefs in midair
and then he saw a big wheel in midair
but sometimes he wasn 't sure whether he was hallucinating or not because the hallucinations would fit in the context of the visions
so on one occasion when his granddaughters were visiting them he said and who are these handsome young men with you
and they said alas grandpapa there are no handsome young men
and then the handsome young men disappeared
it 's typical of these hallucinations that they may come in a flash and disappear in a flash
they don 't usually fade in and out
they are rather sudden and they change suddenly
charles lullin the grandfather saw hundreds of different figures different landscapes of all sorts
on one occasion he saw a man in a bathrobe smoking a pipe and realized it was himself
that was the only figure he recognized
on one occasion when he was walking in the streets of paris he saw this was real a scaffolding
but when he got back home he saw a miniature of the scaffolding six inches high on his study table
this repetition of perception is sometimes called palinopsia
with him and with rosalie what seems to be going on and rosalie said what 's going on and i said that as you lose vision as the visual parts of the brain are no longer getting any input they become hyperactive and excitable and they start to fire spontaneously
and you start to see things
the things you see can be very complicated indeed
with another patient of mine who also had some vision the vision she had could be disturbing
on one occasion she said she saw a man in a striped shirt in a restaurant
and he turned around and then he divided into six figures in striped shirts who started walking towards her
and then the six figures came together again like a concertina
once when she was driving or rather her husband was driving the road divided into four and she felt herself going simultaneously up four roads
she had very mobile hallucinations as well
a lot of them had to do with a car
sometimes she would see a teenage boy sitting on the hood of the car
he was very tenacious and he moved rather gracefully when the car turned
and then when they came to a stop the boy would do a sudden vertical takeoff 100 foot in the air and then disappear
another patient of mine had a different sort of hallucination
this was a woman who didn 't have trouble with her eyes but the visual parts of her brain a little tumor in the occipital cortex
and above all she would see cartoons
these cartoons would be transparent and would cover half the visual field like a screen
and especially she saw cartoons of kermit the frog
now i don 't watch sesame street but she made a point of saying why kermit she said kermit the frog means nothing to me
you know i was wondering about freudian determinants
why kermit
kermit the frog means nothing to me
she didn 't mind the cartoons too much
but what did disturb her was she got very persistent images or hallucinations of faces and as with rosalie the faces were often deformed with very large teeth or very large eyes
and these frightened her
well what is going on with these people
as a physician i have to try and define what 's going on and to reassure people especially to reassure them that they 're not going insane
something like 10 percent as i said of visually impaired people get these
but no more than one percent of the people acknowledge them because they are afraid they will be seen as insane or something
and if they do mention them to their own doctors they may be misdiagnosed
in particular the notion is that if you see things or hear things you 're going mad but the psychotic hallucinations are quite different
psychotic hallucinations whether they are visual or vocal they address you they accuse you
they seduce you they humiliate you
they jeer at you
you interact with them
there is none of this quality of being addressed with these charles bonnet hallucinations
there is a film you 're seeing a film which has nothing to do with you or that 's how people think about it
there is also a rare thing called temporal lobe epilepsy and sometimes if one has this one may feel oneself transported back to a time and place in the past
you 're at a particular road junction
you smell chestnuts roasting
you hear the traffic all the senses are involved
and you 're waiting for your girl
and it 's that tuesday evening back in 1982
and the temporal lobe hallucinations are all-sense hallucinations full of feeling full of familiarity located in space and time coherent dramatic
the charles bonnet ones are quite different
so in the charles bonnet hallucinations you have all sorts of levels from the geometrical hallucinations the pink and blue squares the woman had up to quite elaborate hallucinations with figures and especially faces
faces and sometimes deformed faces are the single commonest thing in these hallucinations
and one of the second commonest is cartoons
so what is going on
fascinatingly in the last few years it 's been possible to do functional brain imagery to do fmri on people as they are hallucinating
and in fact to find that different parts of the visual brain are activated as they are hallucinating
when people have these simple geometrical hallucinations the primary visual cortex is activated
this is the part of the brain which perceives edges and patterns
you don 't form images with your primary visual cortex
when images are formed a higher part of the visual cortex is involved in the temporal lobe
and in particular one area of the temporal lobe is called the fusiform gyrus
and it 's known that if people have damage in the fusiform gyrus they maybe lose the ability to recognize faces
but if there is an abnormal activity in the fusiform gyrus they may hallucinate faces and this is exactly what you find in some of these people
there is an area in the anterior part of this gyrus where teeth and eyes are represented and that part of the gyrus is activated when people get the deformed hallucinations
there is another part of the brain which is especially activated when one sees cartoons
it 's activated when one recognizes cartoons when one draws cartoons and when one hallucinates them
it 's very interesting that that should be specific
there are other parts of the brain which are specifically involved with the recognition and hallucination of buildings and landscapes
around 1970 it was found that there were not only parts of the brain but particular cells
face cells were discovered around 1970
and now we know that there are hundreds of other sorts of cells which can be very very specific
so you may not only have car cells you may have aston martin cells
i saw an aston martin this morning
i had to bring it in
and now it 's in there somewhere
now at this level in what 's called the inferotemporal cortex there are only visual images or figments or fragments
it 's only at higher levels that the other senses join in and there are connections with memory and emotion
and in the charles bonnet syndrome you don 't go to those higher levels
you 're in these levels of inferior visual cortex where you have thousands and tens of thousands and millions of images or figments or fragmentary figments all neurally encoded in particular cells or small clusters of cells
normally these are all part of the integrated stream of perception or imagination and one is not conscious of them
it is only if one is visually impaired or blind that the process is interrupted
and instead of getting normal perception you 're getting an anarchic convulsive stimulation or release of all of these visual cells in the inferotemporal cortex
so suddenly you see a face suddenly you see a car
suddenly this and suddenly that
the mind does its best to organize and to give some sort of coherence to this but not terribly successfully
when these were first described it was thought that they could be interpreted like dreams
but in fact people say i don 't recognize the people i can 't form any associations
kermit means nothing to me
you don 't get anywhere thinking of them as dreams
well i 've more or less said what i wanted
i think i just want to recapitulate and say this is common
think of the number of blind people
there must be hundreds of thousands of blind people who have these hallucinations but are too scared to mention them
so this sort of thing needs to be brought into notice for patients for doctors for the public
finally i think they are infinitely interesting and valuable for giving one some insight as to how the brain works
charles bonnet said 250 years ago he wondered how thinking these hallucinations how as he put it the theater of the mind could be generated by the machinery of the brain
now 250 years later i think we 're beginning to glimpse how this is done
thanks very much
that was superb thank you so much
you speak about these things with so much insight and empathy for your patients
have you yourself experienced any of the syndromes you write about
oliver sacks i was afraid you 'd ask that
well yeah a lot of them
and actually i 'm a little visually impaired myself
i 'm blind in one eye and not terribly good in the other
and i see the geometrical hallucinations
but they stop there
and they don 't disturb you
because you understand what 's doing it it doesn 't make you worried
os well they don 't disturb me any more than my tinnitus which i ignore
they occasionally interest me and i have many pictures of them in my notebooks
i 've gone and had an fmri myself to see how my visual cortex is taking over
and when i see all these hexagons and complex things which i also have in visual migraine i wonder whether everyone sees things like this and whether things like cave art or ornamental art may have been derived from them a bit
that was an utterly utterly fascinating talk
thank you so much for sharing
os thank you thank you
i 'm here today to share with you an extraordinary journey extraordinarily rewarding journey actually which brought me into training rats to save human lives by detecting landmines and tuberculosis
as a child i had two passions
one was a passion for rodents
i had all kinds of rats mice hamsters gerbils squirrels
you name it i bred it and i sold them to pet shops
i also had a passion for africa
growing up in a multicultural environment we had african students in the house and i learned about their stories so different backgrounds dependency on imported know-how goods services exuberant cultural diversity
africa was truly fascinating for me
i became an industrial engineer engineer in product development and i focused on appropriate detection technologies actually the first appropriate technologies for developing countries
i started working in the industry but i wasn 't really happy to contribute to a material consumer society in a linear extracting and manufacturing mode
i quit my job to focus on the real world problem landmines
we 're talking 95 now
princess diana is announcing on tv that landmines form a structural barrier to any development which is really true
as long as these devices are there or there is suspicion of landmines you can 't really enter into the land
actually there was an appeal worldwide for new detectors sustainable in the environments where they 're needed to produce which is mainly in the developing world
we chose rats
why would you choose rats
because aren 't they vermin
well actually rats are in contrary to what most people think about them rats are highly sociable creatures
and actually our product what you see here
there 's a target somewhere here
you see an operator a trained african with his rats in front who actually are left and right
there the animal finds a mine
it scratches on the soil
and the animal comes back for a food reward
very very simple
very sustainable in this environment
here the animal gets its food reward
and that 's how it works
very very simple
now why would you use rats
rats have been used since the 50s last century in all kinds of experiments
rats have more genetic material allocated to olfaction than any other mammal species
they 're extremely sensitive to smell
moreover they have the mechanisms to map all these smells and to communicate about it
now how do we communicate with rats
well don 't talk rat but we have a clicker a standard method for animal training which you see there
a clicker which makes a particular sound with which you can reinforce particular behaviors
first of all we associate the click sound with a food reward which is smashed banana and peanuts together in a syringe
once the animal knows click food click food click food so click is food we bring it in a cage with a hole and actually the animal learns to stick the nose in the hole under which a target scent is placed and to do that for five seconds five seconds which is long for a rat
once the animal knows this we make the task a bit more difficult
it learns how to find the target smell in a cage with several holes up to 10 holes
then the animal learns to walk on a leash in the open and find targets
in the next step animals learn to find real mines in real minefields
they are tested and accredited according to international mine action standards just like dogs have to pass a test
this consists of 400 square meters
there 's a number of mines placed blindly and the team of trainer and their rat have to find all the targets
if the animal does that it gets a license as an accredited animal to be operational in the field just like dogs by the way
maybe one slight difference we can train rats at a fifth of the price of training the mining dog
this is our team in mozambique one tanzanian trainer who transfers the skills to these three mozambican fellows
and you should see the pride in the eyes of these people
they have a skill which makes them much less dependent on foreign aid
moreover this small team together with of course you need the heavy vehicles and the manual de-miners to follow-up
but with this small investment in a rat capacity we have demonstrated in mozambique that we can reduce the cost-price per square meter up to 60 percent of what is currently normal two dollars per square meter we do it at $ 1.18 and we can still bring that price down
question of scale
if you can bring in more rats we can actually make the output even bigger
we have a demonstration site in mozambique
eleven african governments have seen that they can become less dependent by using this technology
they have signed the pact for peace and treaty in the great lakes region and they endorse hero rats to clear their common borders of landmines
but let me bring you to a very different problem
and there 's about 6,000 people last year that walked on a landmine but worldwide last year almost 1.9 million died from tuberculosis as a first cause of infection
especially in africa where t.b. and hiv are strongly linked there is a huge common problem
microscopy the standard who procedure reaches from 40 to 60 percent reliability
in tanzania the numbers don 't lie 45 percent of people t.b. patients get diagnosed with t.b. before they die
it means that if you have t.b. you have more chance that you won 't be detected but will just die from t.b. secondary infections and so on
and if however you are detected very early diagnosed early treatment can start and even in hiv-positives it makes sense
you can actually cure t.b. even in hiv-positives
so in our common language dutch the name for t.b.
is tering which etymologically refers to the smell of tar
already the old chinese and the greek hippocrates have actually published documented that t.b. can be diagnosed based on the volatiles exuding from patients
so what we did is we collected some samples just as a way of testing from hospitals trained rats on them and see if this works and wonder well we can reach 89 percent sensitivity 86 percent specificity using multiple rats in a row
this is how it works and really this is a generic technology
we 're talking now explosives tuberculosis but can you imagine you can actually put anything under there
so how does it work
you have a cassette with 10 samples
you put these 10 samples at once in the cage
an animal only needs two hundredths of a second to discriminate the scent so it goes extremely fast
here it 's already at the third sample
this is a positive sample
it gets a click sound and comes for the food reward
and by doing so very fast we can have like a second-line opinion to see which patients are positive which are negative
just as an indication whereas a microscopist can process 40 samples in a day a rat can process the same amount of samples in seven minutes only
a cage like this a cage like this provided that you have rats and we have now currently 25 tuberculosis rats a cage like this operating throughout the day can process 1,680 samples
can you imagine the potential offspring applications environmental detection of pollutants in soils customs applications detection of illicit goods in containers and so on
but let 's stick first to tuberculosis
i just want to briefly highlight the blue rods are the scores of microscopy only at the five clinics in dar es salaam on a population of 500,000 people where 15,000 reported to get a test done
microscopy for 1,800 patients
and by just presenting the samples once more to the rats and looping those results back we were able to increase case detection rates by over 30 percent
throughout last year we 've been depending on which intervals you take we 've been consistently increasing case detection rates in five hospitals in dar es salaam between 30 and 40 percent
so this is really considerable
knowing that a missed patient by microscopy infects up to 15 people healthy people per year you can be sure that we have saved lots of lives
at least our hero rats have saved lots of lives
the way forward for us is now to standardize this technology
and there are simple things like for instance we have a small laser in the sniffer hole where the animal has to stick for five seconds
so to standardize this
also to standardize the pellets the food rewards and to semi-automate this in order to replicate this on a much larger scale and affect the lives of many more people
to conclude there are also other applications at the horizon
here is a first prototype of our camera rat which is a rat with a rat backpack with a camera that can go under rubble to detect for victims after earthquake and so on
this is in a prototype stage
we don 't have a working system here yet
to conclude i would actually like to say you may think this is about rats these projects but in the end it is about people
it is about empowering vulnerable communities to tackle difficult expensive and dangerous humanitarian detection tasks and doing that with a local resource plenty available
so something completely different is to keep on challenging your perception about the resources surrounding you whether they are environmental technological animal or human
and to respectfully harmonize with them in order to foster a sustainable work
thank you very much
the value of nothing out of nothing comes something
that was an essay i wrote when i was 11 years old and i got a b +
what i 'm going to talk about nothing out of something and how we create
and i 'm gonna try and do that within the 18-minute time span that we were told to stay within and to follow the ted commandments that is actually something that creates a near-death experience but near-death is good for creativity
ok
so i also want to explain because dave eggers said he was going to heckle me if i said anything that was a lie or not true to universal creativity
and i 've done it this way for half the audience who is scientific
when i say we i don 't mean you necessarily i mean me and my right brain my left brain and the one that 's in between that is the censor and tells me what i 'm saying is wrong
and i 'm going do that also by looking at what i think is part of my creative process which includes a number of things that happened actually the nothing started even earlier than the moment in which i 'm creating something new
and that includes nature and nurture and what i refer to as nightmares
now in the nature area we look at whether or not we are innately equipped with something perhaps in our brains some abnormal chromosome that causes this muse-like effect
and some people would say that we 're born with it in some other means
and others like my mother would say that i get my material from past lives
some people would also say that creativity may be a function of some other neurological quirk van gogh syndrome that you have a little bit of you know psychosis or depression
i do have to say somebody i read recently that van gogh wasn 't really necessarily psychotic that he might have had temporal lobe seizures and that might have caused his spurt of creativity and i don 't i suppose it does something in some part of your brain
and i will mention that i actually developed temporal lobe seizures a number of years ago but it was during the time i was writing my last book and some people say that book is quite different
i think that part of it also begins with a sense of identity crisis you know who am i why am i this particular person why am i not black like everybody else
and sometimes you 're equipped with skills but they may not be the kind of skills that enable creativity
i used to draw i thought i would be an artist
and i had a miniature poodle
and it wasn 't bad but it wasn 't really creative
because all i could really do was represent in a very one-on-one way
and i have a sense that i probably copied this from a book
and then i also wasn 't really shining in a certain area that i wanted to be and you know you look at those scores and it wasn 't bad but it was not certainly predictive that i would one day make my living out of the artful arrangement of words
also one of the principles of creativity is to have a little childhood trauma
and i had the usual kind that i think a lot of people had and that is that you know i had expectations placed on me
that figure right there by the way figure right there was a toy given to me when i was but nine years old and it was to help me become a doctor from a very early age
i have some ones that were long lasting from the age of five to 15 this was supposed to be my side occupation and it led to a sense of failure
but actually there was something quite real in my life that happened when i was about 14
and it was discovered that my brother in 1967 and then my father six months later had brain tumors
and my mother believed that something had gone wrong and she was gonna find out what it was and she was gonna fix it
my father was a baptist minister and he believed in miracles and that god 's will would take care of that
but of course they ended up dying six months apart
and after that my mother believed that it was fate or curses she went looking through all the reasons in the universe why this would have happened
everything except randomness she did not believe in randomness
there was a reason for everything
and one of the reasons she thought was that her mother who had died when she was very young was angry at her
and so i had this notion of death all around me because my mother also believed that i would be next and she would be next
and when you are faced with the prospect of death very soon you begin to think very much about everything
you become very creative in a survival sense
and this then led to my big questions
and they 're the same ones that i have today
and they are why do things happen and how do things happen
and the one my mother asked how do i make things happen
it 's a wonderful way to look at these questions when you write a story
because after all in that framework between page one and 300 you have to answer this question of why things happen how things happen in what order they happen what are the influences
how do i as the narrator as the writer also influence that
and it 's also one that i think many of our scientists have been asking
it 's a kind of cosmology and i have to develop a cosmology of my own universe as the creator of that universe
and you see there 's a lot of back and forth in trying to make that happen trying to figure it out years and years oftentimes
so when i look at creativity i also think that it is this sense or this inability to repress my looking at associations in practically anything in life
and i got a lot of them during what 's been going on throughout this conference almost everything that 's been going on
and so i 'm going to use as the metaphor this association quantum mechanics which i really don 't understand but i 'm still gonna use it as the process for explaining how it is the metaphor
so in quantum mechanics of course you have dark energy and dark matter
and it 's the same thing in looking at these questions of how things happen
there 's a lot of unknown and you often don 't know what it is except by its absence
but when you make those associations you want them to come together in a kind of synergy in the story and what you 're finding is what matters the meaning
and that 's what i look for in my work a personal meaning
there is also the uncertainty principle which is part of quantum mechanics as i understand it
and this happens constantly in the writing
and there 's the terrible and dreaded observer effect in which you 're looking for something and you know things are happening simultaneously and you 're looking at it in a different way and you 're trying to really look for the about-ness or what is this story about and if you try too hard then you will only write the about
you won 't discover anything
and what you were supposed to find what you hoped to find in some serendipitous way is no longer there
now i don 't want to ignore the other side of what happens in our universe like many of our scientists have
and so i am going to just throw in string theory here and just say that creative people are multidimensional and there are 11 levels i think of anxiety
and they all operate at the same time
there is also a big question of ambiguity
and i would link that to something called the cosmological constant
and you don 't know what is operating but something is operating there
and ambiguity to me is very uncomfortable in my life and i have it moral ambiguity
it is constantly there and just as an example this is one that recently came to me
it was something i read in an editorial by a woman who was talking about the war in iraq and she said save a man from drowning you are responsible to him for life
a very famous chinese saying she said
and that means because we went into iraq we should stay there until things were solved you know maybe even 100 years
so there was another one that i came across and it 's saving fish from drowning
and it 's what buddhist fishermen say because they 're not supposed to kill anything
and they also have to make a living and people need to be fed
so their way of rationalizing that is they are saving the fish from drowning and unfortunately in the process the fish die
now what 's encapsulated in both these drowning metaphors actually one of them is my mother 's interpretation and it is a famous chinese saying because she said it to me save a man from drowning you are responsible to him for life
and it was a warning don 't get involved in other people 's business or you 're going to get stuck
ok i think if somebody really was drowning she 'd save them
but both of these sayings saving a fish from drowning or saving a man from drowning to me they had to do with intentions
and all of us in life when we see a situation we have a response
and then we have intentions
there 's an ambiguity of what that should be that we should do and then we do something
and the results of that may not match what our intentions had been
maybe things go wrong and so after that what are our responsibilities
what are we supposed to do
do we stay in for life or do we do something else and justify and say well my intentions were good and therefore i cannot be held responsible for all of it
that is the ambiguity in my life that really disturbed me and led me to write a book called saving fish from drowning
i saw examples of that once i identified this question it was all over the place
i got these hints everywhere
and then in a way i knew that they had always been there
and then writing that 's what happens i get these hints these clues and i realize that they 've been obvious and yet they have not been
and what i need in effect is a focus
and when i have the question it is a focus
and all these things that seem to be flotsam and jetsam in life actually go through that question and what happens is those particular things become relevant
and it seems like it 's happening all the time
you think there 's a sort of coincidence going on a serendipity in which you 're getting all this help from the universe
and it may also be explained that now you have a focus
and you are noticing it more often
but you apply this
you begin to look at things having to do with your tensions
your brother who 's fallen in trouble do you take care of him
why or why not
it may be something that is perhaps more serious as i said human rights in burma
i was thinking that i shouldn 't go because somebody said if i did it would show that i approved of the military regime there
and then after a while i had to ask myself why do we take on knowledge why do we take on assumptions that other people have given us
and it was the same thing that i felt when i was growing up and was hearing these rules of moral conduct from my father who was a baptist minister
so i decided that i would go to burma for my own intentions and still didn 't know that if i went there what the result of that would be if i wrote a book and i just would have to face that later when the time came
we are all concerned with things that we see in the world that we are aware of
we come to this point and say what do i as an individual do
not all of us can go to africa or work at hospitals so what do we do if we have this moral response this feeling
also i think one of the biggest things we are all looking at and we talked about today is genocide
this leads to this question
when i look at all these things that are morally ambiguous and uncomfortable and i consider what my intentions should be i realize it goes back to this identity question that i had when i was a child and why am i here and what is the meaning of my life and what is my place in the universe
it seems so obvious and yet it is not
we all hate moral ambiguity in some sense and yet it is also absolutely necessary
in writing a story it is the place where i begin
sometimes i get help from the universe it seems
my mother would say it was the ghost of my grandmother from the very first book because it seemed i knew things i was not supposed to know
instead of writing that the grandmother died accidentally from an overdose of opium while having too much of a good time i actually put down in the story that the woman killed herself and that actually was the way it happened
and my mother decided that that information must have come from my grandmother
there are also things quite uncanny which bring me information that will help me in the writing of the book
in this case i was writing a story that included some kind of detail period of history a certain location
and i needed to find something historically that would match that
and i took down this book and i first page that i flipped it to was exactly the setting and the time period and the kind of character i needed was the taiping rebellion happening in the area near guilin outside of that and a character who thought he was the son of god
you wonder are these things random chance
well what is random what is chance what is luck
what are things that you get from the universe that you can 't really explain
and that goes into the story too
these are the things i constantly think about from day to day
especially when good things happen and in particular when bad things happen
but i do think there 's a kind of serendipity and i do want to know what those elements are so i can thank them and also try to find them in my life
because again i think that when i am aware of them more of them happen
another chance encounter is when i went to a place i just was with some friends and we drove randomly to a different place and we ended up in this non-tourist location a beautiful village pristine
and we walked three valleys beyond and the third valley there was something quite mysterious and ominous a discomfort i felt and then i knew that had to be [ the ] setting of my book
and in writing one of the scenes it happened in that third valley
for some reason i wrote about cairns stacks of rocks that a man was building
and i didn 't know exactly why i had it but it was so vivid
i got stuck and a friend when she asked if i would go for a walk with her dogs that i said sure and about 45 minutes later walking along the beach i came across this
and it was a man a chinese man and he was stacking these things not with glue not with anything
and i asked him how is it possible to do this
and he said well i guess with everything in life there 's a place of balance
and this was exactly the meaning of my story at that point
i had so many examples i have so many instances like this when i 'm writing a story and i cannot explain it
is it because i had the filter that i have such a strong coincidence in writing about these things
or is it a kind of serendipity that we cannot explain like the cosmological constant
a big thing that i also think about is accidents
and as i said my mother did not believe in randomness
what is the nature of accidents
and how are we going to assign what the responsibility and the causes are outside of a court of law
i was able to see that in a firsthand way when i went to beautiful dong village in guizhou the poorest province of china
and i saw this beautiful place i knew i wanted to come back
and i had a chance to do that when national geographic asked me if i wanted to write anything about china
and i said yes about this village of singing people singing minority
and they agreed and between the time i saw this place and the next time i went there was a terrible accident a man an old man fell asleep and his quilt dropped in a pan of fire that kept him warm
60 homes were destroyed and 40 were damaged
responsibility was assigned to the family
the man 's sons were banished to live three kilometers away in a cowshed
and of course as westerners we say well it was an accident that 's not fair
it 's the son not the father
when i go on a story i have to let go of those kinds of beliefs
it takes a while but i have to let go of them and just go there and be there
and so i was there on three occasions different seasons
and i began to sense something different about the history and what had happened before and the nature of life in a very poor village and what you find as your joys and your rituals your traditions your links with other families and i saw how this had a kind of justice in its responsibility
i was able to find out also about the ceremony that they were using a ceremony they hadn 't used in about 29 years and it was to send some men a feng shui master sent men down to the underworld on ghost horses
now you as westerners and i as westerners would say well that 's superstition but after being there for a while and seeing the amazing things that happened you begin to wonder whose beliefs are those that are in operation in the world determining how things happen
so i remained with them and the more i wrote that story the more i got into those beliefs and i think that 's important for me to take on the beliefs because that is where the story is real and that is where i 'm gonna find the answers to how i feel about certain questions that i have in life
years go by of course and the writing it doesn 't happen instantly as i 'm trying to convey it to you here at ted
the book comes and it goes when it arrives it is no longer my book
it is in the hands of readers and they interpret it differently
but i go back to this question of how do i create something out of nothing
and how do i create my own life
and i think it is by questioning and saying to myself that there are no absolute truths
i believe in specifics the specifics of story and the past the specifics of that past and what is happening in the story at that point
i also believe that in thinking about things my thinking about luck and fate and coincidences and accidents god 's will and the synchrony of mysterious forces i will come to some notion of what that is how we create
i have to think of my role where i am in the universe and did somebody intend for me to be that way or is it just something i came up with
and i also can find that by imagining fully and becoming what is imagined and yet is in that real world the fictional world
and that is how i find particles of truth not the absolute truth or the whole truth
and they have to be in all possibilities including those i never considered before
so there are never complete answers
or rather if there is an answer it is to remind myself that there is uncertainty in everything and that is good because then i will discover something new
and if there is a partial answer a more complete answer from me it is to simply imagine
and to imagine is to put myself in that story until there was only there is a transparency between me and the story that i am creating
and that 's how i 've discovered that if i feel what is in the story in one story then i come the closest i think to knowing what compassion is to feeling that compassion
because for everything in that question of how things happen it has to do with the feeling
i have to become the story in order to understand a lot of that
we 've come to the end of the talk and i will reveal what is in the bag and it is the muse and it is the things that transform in our lives that are wonderful and stay with us
there she is
thank you very much

so in my free time outside of twitter i experiment a little bit with telling stories online experimenting with what we can do with new digital tools
and in my job at twitter i actually spent a little bit of time working with authors and storytellers as well helping to expand out the bounds of what people are experimenting with
and i want to talk through some examples today of things that people have done that i think are really fascinating using flexible identity and anonymity on the web and blurring the lines between fact and fiction
but i want to start and go back to the 1930s
long before a little thing called twitter radio brought us broadcasts and connected millions of people to single points of broadcast
and from those single points emanated stories
some of them were familiar stories
some of them were new stories
and for a while they were familiar formats but then radio began to evolve its own unique formats specific to that medium
think about episodes that happened live on radio
combining the live play and the serialization of written fiction you get this new format
and the reason why i bring up radio is that i think radio is a great example of how a new medium defines new formats which then define new stories
and of course today we have an entirely new medium to play with which is this online world
this is the map of verified users on twitter and the connections between them
there are thousands upon thousands of them
every single one of these points is its own broadcaster
we 've gone to this world of many to many where access to the tools is the only barrier to broadcasting
and i think that we should start to see wildly new formats emerge as people learn how to tell stories in this new medium
i actually believe that we are in a wide open frontier for creative experimentation if you will that we 've explored and begun to settle this wild land of the internet and are now just getting ready to start to build structures on it and those structures are the new formats of storytelling that the internet will allow us to create
i believe this starts with an evolution of existing methods
the short story for example people are saying that the short story is experiencing a renaissance of sorts thanks to e-readers digital marketplaces
one writer hugh howey experimented with short stories on amazon by releasing one very short story called wool
and he actually says that he didn 't intend for wool to become a series but that the audience loved the first story so much they demanded more and so he gave them more
he gave them wool 2 which was a little bit longer than the first one wool 3 which was even longer culminating in wool 5 which was a 60,000-word novel
i think howey was able to do all of this because he had the quick feedback system of e-books
he was able to write and publish in relatively short order
there was no mediator between him and the audience
it was just him directly connected with his audience and building on the feedback and enthusiasm that they were giving him
so this whole project was an experiment
it started with the one short story and i think the experimentation actually became a part of howey 's format
and that 's something that this medium enabled was experimentation being a part of the format itself
this is a short story by the author jennifer egan called black box
it was originally written specifically with twitter in mind
egan convinced the new yorker to start a new yorker fiction account from which they could tweet all of these lines that she created
now twitter of course has a 140-character limit
egan mocked that up just writing manually in this storyboard sketchbook used the physical space constraints of those storyboard squares to write each individual tweet and those tweets ended up becoming over 600 of them that were serialized by the new yorker
every night at 8 p.m. you could tune in to a short story from the new yorker 's fiction account
i think that 's pretty exciting tune-in literary fiction
the experience of egan 's story of course like anything on twitter there were multiple ways to experience it
you could scroll back through it but interestingly if you were watching it live there was this suspense that built because the actual tweets you had no control over when you would read them
they were coming at a pretty regular clip but as the story was building normally as a reader you control how fast you move through a text but in this case the new yorker did and they were sending you bit by bit by bit and you had this suspense of waiting for the next line
another great example of fiction and the short story on twitter elliott holt is an author who wrote a story called evidence
it began with this tweet on november 28 at 10 13 p.m. a woman identified as miranda brown 44 of brooklyn fell to her death from the roof of a manhattan hotel
it begins in elliott 's voice but then elliott 's voice recedes and we hear the voices of elsa margot and simon characters that elliott created on twitter specifically to tell this story a story from multiple perspectives leading up to this moment at 10 13 p.m.
when this woman falls to her death
these three characters brought an authentic vision from multiple perspectives
one reviewer called elliott 's story twitter fiction done right because she did
she captured that voice and she had multiple characters and it happened in real time
interestingly though it wasn 't just twitter as a distribution mechanism
it was also twitter as a production mechanism
elliott told me later she wrote the whole thing with her thumbs
she laid on the couch and just went back and forth between different characters tweeting out each line line by line
i think that this kind of spontaneous creation of what was coming out of the characters voices really lent an authenticity to the characters themselves but also to this format that she had created of multiple perspectives in a single story on twitter
as you begin to play with flexible identity online it gets even more interesting as you start to interact with the real world
things like invisible obama or the famous binders full of women that came up during the 2012 election cycle or even the fan fiction universe of west wing twitter in which you have all of these accounts for every single one of the characters in the west wing including the bird that taps at josh lyman 's window in one single episode
all of these are rapid iterations on a theme
they are creative people experimenting with the bounds of what is possible in this medium
you look at something like west wing twitter in which you have these fictional characters that engage with the real world
they comment on politics they cry out against the evils of congress
keep in mind they 're all democrats
and they engage with the real world
they respond to it
so once you take flexible identity anonymity engagement with the real world and you move beyond simple homage or parody and you put these tools to work in telling a story that 's when things get really interesting
so during the chicago mayoral election there was a parody account
it was mayor emanuel
it gave you everything you wanted from rahm emanuel particularly in the expletive department
this foul-mouthed account followed the daily activities of the race providing commentary as it went
it followed all of the natural tropes of a good solid twitter parody account but then started to get weird
and as it progressed it moved from this commentary to a multi-week real-time science fiction epic in which your protagonist rahm emanuel engages in multi-dimensional travel on election day which is it didn 't actually happen
i double checked the newspapers
and then very interestingly it came to an end
this is something that doesn 't usually happen with a twitter parody account
it ended a true narrative conclusion
and so the author dan sinker who was a journalist who was completely anonymous this whole time i think dan it made a lot of sense for him to turn this into a book because it was a narrative format in the end and i think that turning it into a book is representative of this idea that he had created something new that needed to be translated into previous formats
one of my favorite examples of something that 's happening on twitter right now actually is the very absurdist crimer show
crimer show tells the story of a supercriminal and a hapless detective that face off in this exceptionally strange lingo with all of the tropes of a television show
crimer show 's creator has said that it is a parody of a popular type of show in the u.k. but man is it weird
and there are all these times where crimer the supercriminal does all of these tv things
he 's always taking off his sunglasses or turning to the camera but these things just happen in text
i think borrowing all of these tropes from television and additionally presenting each crimer show as an episode spelled e-p-p-a-s-o-d eppasod presenting them as episodes really it creates something new
there is a new eppasod of crimer show on twitter pretty much every day and they 're archived that way
and i think this is an interesting experiment in format
something totally new has been created here out of parodying something on television
i think in nonfiction real-time storytelling there are a lot of really excellent examples as well
realtimewwii is an account that documents what was happening on this day 60 years ago in exceptional detail as if you were reading the news reports from that day
and the author teju cole has done a lot of experimentation with putting a literary twist on events of the news
in this particular case he 's talking about drone strikes
i think that in both of these examples you 're beginning to see ways in which people are telling stories with nonfiction content that can be built into new types of fictional storytelling
so with real-time storytelling blurring the lines between fact and fiction the real world and the digital world flexible identity anonymity these are all tools that we have accessible to us and i think that they 're just the building blocks
they are the bits that we use to create the structures the frames that then become our settlements on this wide open frontier for creative experimentation

that year she introduced me to dance and thus began my tryst with classical dance
since then it 's been four decades now i 've trained with the best in the field performed across the globe taught young and old alike created collaborated choreographed and wove a rich tapestry of artistry achievement and awards
the crowning glory was in 2007 when i received this country 's fourth highest civilian award the padma shri for my contribution to art
but nothing nothing prepared me for what i was to hear on the first of july 2008
i heard the word carcinoma
yes breast cancer
as i sat dumbstruck in my doctor 's office i heard other words cancer stage grade
until then cancer was the zodiac sign of my friend stage was what i performed on and grades were what i got in school
that day i realized i had an unwelcome uninvited new life partner
as a dancer i know the nine rasas or the navarasas anger valor disgust humor and fear
i thought i knew what fear was
that day i learned what fear was
overcome with the enormity of it all and the complete feeling of loss of control i shed copious tears and asked my dear husband jayant
i said is this it is this the end of the road
is this the end of my dance
and he the positive soul that he is said no this is just a hiatus a hiatus during the treatment and you 'll get back to doing what you do best
i realized then that i who thought i had complete control of my life had control of only three things my thought my mind the images that these thoughts created and the action that derived from it
so here i was wallowing in a vortex of emotions and depression and what have you with the enormity of the situation wanting to go to a place of healing health and happiness
i wanted to go from where i was to where i wanted to be for which i needed something
i needed something that would pull me out of all this
so i dried my tears and i declared to the world at large ...
i said cancer 's only one page in my life and i will not allow this page to impact the rest of my life
i also declared to the world at large that i would ride it out and i would not allow cancer to ride me
but to go from where i was to where i wanted to be i needed something
i needed an anchor an image a peg to peg this process on so that i could go from there
and i found that in my dance my dance my strength my energy my passion my very life breath
but it wasn 't easy
believe me it definitely wasn 't easy
how do you keep cheer when you go from beautiful to bald in three days
how do you not despair when with the body ravaged by chemotherapy climbing a mere flight of stairs was sheer torture that to someone like me who could dance for three hours
how do you not get overwhelmed by the despair and the misery of it all
all i wanted to do was curl up and weep
but i kept telling myself fear and tears are options i did not have
so i would drag myself into my dance studio body mind and spirit every day into my dance studio and learn everything i learned when i was four all over again reworked relearned regrouped
it was excruciatingly painful but i did it
difficult
i focused on my mudras on the imagery of my dance on the poetry and the metaphor and the philosophy of the dance itself
and slowly i moved out of that miserable state of mind
but i needed something else
i needed something to go that extra mile and i found it in that metaphor which i had learned from my mother when i was four
the metaphor of mahishasura mardhini of durga
durga the mother goddess the fearless one created by the pantheon of hindu gods
durga resplendent bedecked beautiful her 18 arms ready for warfare as she rode astride her lion into the battlefield to destroy mahishasur
durga the epitome of creative feminine energy or shakti
durga the fearless one
i made that image of durga and her every attribute her every nuance my very own
powered by the symbology of a myth and the passion of my training i brought laser-sharp focus into my dance laser-sharp focus to such an extent that i danced a few weeks after surgery
i danced through chemo and radiation cycles much to the dismay of my oncologist
i danced between chemo and radiation cycles and badgered him to fit it to my performing dance schedule
what i had done is i had tuned out of cancer and tuned into my dance
yes cancer has just been one page in my life
my story is a story of overcoming setbacks obstacles and challenges that life throws at you
my story is the power of thought
my story is the power of choice
it 's the power of focus
it 's the power of bringing ourselves to the attention of something that so animates you so moves you that something even like cancer becomes insignificant
my story is the power of a metaphor
it 's the power of an image
mine was that of durga durga the fearless one
she was also called simhanandini the one who rode the lion
as i ride out as i ride my own inner strength my own inner resilience armed as i am with what medication can provide and continue treatment as i ride out into the battlefield of cancer asking my rogue cells to behave i want to be known not as a cancer survivor but as a cancer conqueror
i present to you an excerpt of that work simhanandini

jambo bonjour zdravstvujtye dayo these are a few of the languages that i 've spoken little bits of over the course of the last six weeks as i 've been to 17 countries i think i 'm up to on this crazy tour i 've been doing checking out various aspects of the project that we 're doing
and i 'm going to tell you a little bit about later on
and visiting some pretty incredible places places like mongolia cambodia new guinea south africa tanzania twice i was here a month ago
and the opportunity to make a whirlwind tour of the world like that is utterly amazing for lots of reasons
you see some incredible stuff
and you get to make these spot comparisons between people all around the globe
and the thing that you really take away from that the kind of surface thing that you take away from it is not that we 're all one although i 'm going to tell you about that but rather how different we are
there is so much diversity around the globe
6,000 different languages spoken by six and a half billion people all different colors shapes sizes
you walk down the street in any big city you travel like that and you are amazed at the diversity in the human species
how do we explain that diversity
well that 's what i 'm going to talk about today is how we 're using the tools of genetics population genetics in particular to tell us how we generated this diversity and how long it took
now the problem of human diversity like all big scientific questions how do you explain something like that can be broken down into sub-questions
and you can ferret away at those little sub-questions
first one is really a question of origins
do we all share a common origin in fact
and given that we do and that 's the assumption everybody i think in this room would make when was that
when did we originate as a species
how long have we been divergent from each other
and the second question is related but slightly different
if we do spring from a common source how did we come to occupy every corner of the globe and in the process generate all of this diversity the different ways of life the different appearances the different languages around the world
well the question of origins as with so many other questions in biology seems to have been answered by darwin over a century ago
in the descent of man he wrote in each great region of the world the living mammals are closely related to the extinct species of the same region
it 's therefore probable that africa was formerly inhabited by extinct apes closely allied to the gorilla and chimpanzee and as these two species are now man 's nearest allies it 's somewhat more probable that our early progenitors lived on the african continent than elsewhere
so we 're done we can go home finished the origin question
well not quite because darwin was talking about our distant ancestry our common ancestry with apes
and it is quite clear that apes originated on the african continent
around 23 million years ago they appear in the fossil record
africa was actually disconnected from the other landmasses at that time due to the vagaries of plate tectonics floating around the indian ocean
bumped into eurasia around 16 million years ago and then we had the first african exodus as we call it
the apes that left at that time ended up in southeast asia became the gibbons and the orangutans
and the ones that stayed on in africa evolved into the gorillas the chimpanzees and us
so yes if you 're talking about our common ancestry with apes it 's very clear by looking at the fossil record we started off here
but that 's not really the question i 'm asking
i 'm asking about our human ancestry things that we would recognize as being like us if they were sitting here in the room
if they were peering over your shoulder you wouldn 't leap back like that what about our human ancestry
because if we go far enough back we share a common ancestry with every living thing on earth
dna ties us all together so we share ancestry with barracuda and bacteria and mushrooms if you go far enough back over a billion years
what we 're asking about though is human ancestry
how do we study that
well historically it has been studied using the science of paleoanthropology
digging things up out of the ground and largely on the basis of morphology the way things are shaped often skull shape saying this looks a little bit more like us than that so this must be my ancestor
this must be who i 'm directly descended from
the field of paleoanthropology i 'll argue gives us lots of fascinating possibilities about our ancestry but it doesn 't give us the probabilities that we really want as scientists
what do i mean by that
you 're looking at a great example here
these are three extinct species of hominids potential human ancestors
all dug up just west of here in olduvai gorge by the leakey family
and they 're all dating to roughly the same time
from left to right we 've got homo erectus homo habilis and australopithecus now called paranthropus boisei the robust australopithecine three extinct species same place same time
that means that not all three could be my direct ancestor
which one of these guys am i actually related to
possibilities about our ancestry but not the probabilities that we 're really looking for
well a different approach has been to look at morphology in humans using the only data that people really had at hand until quite recently again largely skull shape
the first person to do this systematically was linnaeus carl von linne a swedish botanist who in the eighteenth century took it upon himself to categorize every living organism on the planet
you think you 've got a tough job
and he did a pretty good job
he categorized about 12,000 species in systema naturae
he actually coined the term homo sapiens it means wise man in latin
but looking around the world at the diversity of humans he said well you know we seem to come in discreet sub-species or categories
and he talked about africans and americans and asians and europeans and a blatantly racist category he termed monstrosus which basically included all the people he didn 't like including imaginary folk like elves
it 's easy to dismiss this as the perhaps well-intentioned but ultimately benighted musings of an eighteenth century scientist working in the pre-darwinian era
except if you had taken physical anthropology as recently as 20 or 30 years ago in many cases you would have learned basically that same classification of humanity
human races that according to physical anthropologists of 30 40 years ago carlton coon is the best example had been diverging from each other this was in the post-darwinian era for over a million years since the time of homo erectus
but based on what data
very little very little morphology and a lot of guesswork
well what i 'm going to talk about today what i 'm going to talk about now is a new approach to this problem
instead of going out and guessing about our ancestry digging things up out of the ground possible ancestors and saying it on the basis of morphology which we still don 't completely understand we don 't know the genetic causes underlying this morphological variation what we need to do is turn the problem on its head
because what we 're really asking is a genealogical problem or a genealogical question
what we 're trying to do is construct a family tree for everybody alive today
and as any genealogist will tell you anybody have a member of the family or maybe you have tried to construct a family tree trace back in time
you start in the present with relationships you 're certain about
you and your siblings you have a parent in common
you and your cousins share a grandparent in common
you gradually trace further and further back into the past adding these ever more distant relationships
but eventually no matter how good you are at digging up the church records and all that stuff you hit what the genealogists call a brick wall
a point beyond which you don 't know anything else about your ancestors and you enter this dark and mysterious realm we call history that we have to feel our way through with whispered guidance
who were these people who came before
we have no written record well actually we do
written in our dna in our genetic code we have a historical document that takes us back in time to the very earliest days of our species and that 's what we study
now a quick primer on dna
i suspect that not everybody in the audience is a geneticist
it is a very long linear molecule a coded version of how to make another copy of you it 's your blueprint
it 's composed of four subunits a c g and t we call them
and it 's the sequence of those subunits that defines that blueprint
how long is it well it 's billions of these subunits in length
a haploid genome we actually have two copies of all of our chromosomes a haploid genome is around 3.2 billion nucleotides in length
and the whole thing if you add it all together is over six billion nucleotides long
if you take all the dna out of one cell in your body and stretch it end to end it 's around two meters long
if you take all the dna out of every cell in your body and you stretch it end to end it would reach from here to the moon and back thousands of times it 's a lot of information
and so when you 're copying this dna molecule to pass it on it 's a pretty tough job
imagine the longest book you can think of war and peace
now multiply it by 100
and imagine copying that by hand
and you 're working away until late at night and you 're very very careful and you 're drinking coffee and you 're paying attention but occasionally when you 're copying this by hand you 're going to make a little typo a spelling mistake substitute an i for an e or a c for a t .
same thing happens to our dna as it 's being passed on through the generations
it doesn 't happen very often we have a proofreading mechanism built in
but when it does happen and these changes get transmitted down through the generations they become markers of descent
if you share a marker with someone it means you share an ancestor at some point in the past the person who first had that change in their dna
and it 's by looking at the pattern of genetic variation the pattern of these markers in people all over the world and assessing the relative ages when they occurred throughout our history that we 've been able to construct a family tree for everybody alive today
these are two pieces of dna that we use quite widely in our work
mitochondrial dna tracing a purely maternal line of descent
you get your mtdna from your mother and your mother 's mother all the way back to the very first woman
the y chromosome the piece of dna that makes men men traces a purely paternal line of descent
everybody in this room everybody in the world falls into a lineage somewhere on these trees
now even though these are simplified versions of the real trees they 're still kind of complicated so let 's simplify them
turn them on their sides combine them so that they look like a tree with the root at the bottom and the branches going up
what 's the take-home message
well the thing that jumps out at you first is that the deepest lineages in our family trees are found within africa among africans
that means that africans have been accumulating this mutational diversity for longer
and what that means is that we originated in africa it 's written in our dna
every piece of dna we look at has greater diversity within africa than outside of africa
and at some point in the past a sub-group of africans left the african continent to go out and populate the rest of the world
now how recently do we share this ancestry
was it millions of years ago which we might suspect by looking at all this incredible variation around the world
no the dna tells a story that 's very clear
within the last 200,000 years we all share an ancestor a single person mitochondrial eve you might have heard about her in africa an african woman who gave rise to all the mitochondrial diversity in the world today
but what 's even more amazing is that if you look at the y-chromosome side the male side of the story the y-chromosome adam only lived around 60,000 years ago
that 's only about 2,000 human generations the blink of an eye in an evolutionary sense
that tells us we were all still living in africa at that time
this was an african man who gave rise to all the y chromosome diversity around the world
it 's only within the last 60,000 years that we have started to generate this incredible diversity we see around the world
such an amazing story
we 're all effectively part of an extended african family
now that seems so recent why didn 't we start to leave earlier
why didn 't homo erectus evolve into separate species or sub-species rather human races around the world
why was it that we seem to have come out of africa so recently
well that 's a big question these why questions particularly in genetics and the study of history in general are always the big ones the ones that are tough to answer
and so when all else fails talk about the weather
what was going on to the world 's weather around 60,000 years ago
well we were going into the worst part of the last ice age
the last ice age started roughly 120,000 years ago
it went up and down and it really started to accelerate around 70,000 years ago
lots of evidence from sediment cores and the pollen types oxygen isotopes and so on
we hit the last glacial maximum around 16,000 years ago but basically from 70,000 years on things were getting really tough getting very cold the northern hemisphere had massive growing ice sheets
new york city chicago seattle all under a sheet of ice
most of britain all of scandinavia covered by ice several kilometers thick
now africa is the most tropical continent on the planet about 85 percent of it lies between cancer and capricorn and there aren 't a lot of glaciers here except on the high mountains here in east africa
so what was going on here we weren 't covered in ice in africa
rather africa was drying out at that time
this is a paleo-climatological map of what africa looked like between 60,000 and 70,000 years ago reconstructed from all these pieces of evidence that i mentioned before
the reason for that is that ice actually sucks moisture out of the atmosphere
if you think about antarctica it 's technically a desert it gets so little precipitation
so the whole world was drying out
the sea levels were dropping and africa was turning to desert
the sahara was much bigger then than it is now
and the human habitat was reduced to just a few small pockets compared to what we have today
the evidence from genetic data is that the human population around this time roughly 70,000 years ago crashed to fewer than 2,000 individuals
we nearly went extinct we were hanging on by our fingernails
and then something happened a great illustration of it
look at some stone tools
the ones on the left are from africa from around a million years ago
the ones on the right were made by neanderthals our distant cousins not our direct ancestors living in europe and they date from around 50,000 or 60,000 years ago
now at the risk of offending any paleoanthropologists or physical anthropologists in the audience basically there 's not a lot of change between these two stone tool groups
the ones on the left are pretty similar to the ones on the right
we are in a period of long cultural stasis from a million years ago until around 60,000 to 70,000 years ago
the tool styles don 't change that much
the evidence is that the human way of life didn 't change that much during that period
but then 50 60 70 thousand years ago somewhere in that region all hell breaks loose art makes its appearance
the stone tools become much more finely crafted
the evidence is that humans begin to specialize in particular prey species at particular times of the year
the population size started to expand
probably according to what many linguists believe fully modern language syntactic language subject verb object that we use to convey complex ideas like i 'm doing now appeared around that time
we became much more social the social networks expanded
this change in behavior allowed us to survive these worsening conditions in africa and they allowed us to start to expand around the world
we 've been talking at this conference about african success stories
well you want the ultimate african success story
look in the mirror you 're it the reason you 're alive today is because of those changes in our brains that took place in africa probably somewhere in the region where we 're sitting right now around 60 70 thousand years ago allowing us not only to survive in africa but to expand out of africa
an early coastal migration along the south coast of asia leaving africa around 60,000 years ago reaching australia very rapidly by 50,000 years ago
a slightly later migration up into the middle east
these would have been savannah hunters
so those of you who are going on one of the post-conference tours you 'll get to see what a real savannah is like
and it 's basically a meat locker
people who would have specialized in killing the animals hunting the animals on those meat locker savannahs moving up following the grasslands into the middle east around 45,000 years ago during one of the rare wet phases in the sahara
migrating eastward following the grasslands because that 's what they were adapted to live on
and when they reached central asia they reached what was effectively a steppe super-highway a grassland super-highway
the grasslands at that time this was during the last ice age stretched basically from germany all the way over to korea and the entire continent was open to them
entering europe around 35,000 years ago and finally a small group migrating up through the worst weather imaginable siberia inside the arctic circle during the last ice age temperature was at -70 -80 even -100 perhaps migrating into the americas ultimately reaching that final frontier
an amazing story and it happened first in africa
the changes that allowed us to do that the evolution of this highly adaptable brain that we all carry around with us allowing us to create novel cultures allowing us to develop the diversity that we see on a whirlwind trip like the one i 've just been on
now that story i just told you is literally a whirlwind tour of how we populated the world the great paleolithic wanderings of our species
and that 's the story that i told a couple of years ago in my book the journey of man and a film that we made with the same title
and as we were finishing up that film it was co-produced with national geographic i started talking to the folks at ng about this work
and they got really excited about it they liked the film but they said you know we really see this as kind of the next wave in the study of human origins where we all came from using the tools of dna to map the migrations around the world
you know the study of human origins is kind of in our dna and we want to take it to the next level
what do you want to do next
which is a great question to be asked by national geographic
and i said well you know what i 've sketched out here is just that
it is a very coarse sketch of how we migrated around the planet
and it 's based on a few thousand people we 've sampled from you know a handful of populations around the world
studied a few genetic markers and there are lots of gaps on this map
we 've just connected the dots what we need to do is increase our sample size by an order of magnitude or more hundreds of thousands of dna samples from people all over the world
and that was the genesis of the genographic project
the project launched in april 2005
it has three core components obviously science is a big part of it
the field research that we 're doing around the world with indigenous peoples
people who have lived in the same location for a long period of time retain a connection to the place where they live that many of the rest of us have lost
so my ancestors come from all over northern europe
i live in the eastern seaboard of north america when i 'm not traveling
where am i indigenous to nowhere really my genes are all jumbled up
but there are people who retain that link to their ancestors that allows us to contextualize the dna results
that 's the focus of the field research the centers that we 've set up all over the world 10 of them top population geneticists
but in addition we wanted to open up this study to anybody around the world
how often do you get to participate in a big scientific project
the human genome project or a mars rover mission
in this case you actually can
you can go onto our website nationalgeographic.com genographic
you can order a kit you can test your own dna
and you can actually submit those results to the database and tell us a little about your genealogical background have the data analyzed as part of the scientific effort
now this is all a nonprofit enterprise and so the money that we raise after we cover the cost of doing the testing and making the kit components gets plowed back into the project
the majority going to something we call the legacy fund
it 's a charitable entity basically a grant-giving entity that gives money back to indigenous groups around the world for educational cultural projects initiated by them
they apply to this fund in order to do various projects and i 'll show you a couple of examples
so how are we doing on the project we 've got about 25,000 samples collected from indigenous people around the world
the most amazing thing has been the interest on the part of the public 210,000 people have ordered these participation kits since we launched two years ago which has raised around five million dollars the majority of which at least half is going back into the legacy fund
we 've just awarded the first legacy grants totaling around 500,000 dollars
projects around the world documenting oral poetry in sierra leone preserving traditional weaving patterns in gaza language revitalization in tajikistan etc etc
so the project is going very very well and i urge you to check out the website and watch this space
thank you very much
i 've been playing ted for nearly a decade and i 've very rarely played any new songs of my own
and that was largely because there weren 't any
so i 've been busy with a couple of projects and one of them was this the nutmeg
a 1930s ship 's lifeboat which i 've been restoring in the garden of my beach house in england
and so now when the polar ice caps melt my recording studio will rise up like an ark and i 'll float off into the drowned world like a character from a j.g. ballard novel
during the day the nutmeg collects energy from solar panels on the roof of the wheelhouse and from a 450 watt turbine up the mast
so that when it gets dark i 've got plenty of power
and i can light up the nutmeg like a beacon
and so i go in there until the early hours of the morning and i work on new songs
i 'd like to play to you guys if you 're willing to be the first audience to hear it
it 's about billie holiday
and it appears that some night in 1947 she left her physical space and was missing all night until she reappeared in the morning
but i know where she was
she was with me on my lifeboat
and she was hot
billie crept softly into my waking arms warm like a sip of sour mash strange fruit for a sweet hunk of trash panic at the stage door of carnegie hall famous jazz singer gone awol must have left the building body and soul on a creaky piano stool tonight as the moon is my only witness she was breathing in my ear this time it 's love but love is a loaded pistol by daybreak she 's gone over the frozen river home me and johnny walker see in the new age alone stay with me again tonight billie time time is a wily trickster still an echo in my heart says this time it 's love
i was basically concerned about what was going on in the world
i couldn 't understand the starvation the destruction the killing of innocent people
making sense of those things is a very difficult thing to do
and when i was 12 i became an actor
i was bottom of the class i haven 't got any qualifications
i was told i was dyslexic
in fact i have got qualifications
i got a d in pottery which was the one thing that i did get which was useful obviously
and so concern is where all of this comes from
and then being an actor i was doing these different kinds of things and i felt the content of the work that i was involved in really wasn 't cutting it that there surely had to be more
and at that point i read a book by frank barnaby this wonderful nuclear physicist and he said that media had a responsibility that all sectors of society had a responsibility to try and progress things and move things forward
and that fascinated me because i 'd been messing around with a camera most of my life
and then i thought well maybe i could do something
maybe i could become a filmmaker
maybe i can use the form of film constructively to in some way make a difference
maybe there 's a little change i can get involved in
so i started thinking about peace and i was obviously as i said to you very much moved by these images trying to make sense of that
could i go and speak to older and wiser people who would tell me how they made sense of the things that are going on
because it 's obviously incredibly frightening
but i realized that having been messing around with structure as an actor that a series of sound bites in itself wasn 't enough that there needed to be a mountain to climb there needed to be a journey that i had to take
and if i took that journey no matter whether it failed or succeeded it would be completely irrelevant
the point was that i would have something to hook the questions of is humankind fundamentally evil
is the destruction of the world inevitable should i have children
is that a responsible thing to do etc etc
so i was thinking about peace and then i was thinking well where 's the starting point for peace
and that was when i had the idea
there was no starting point for peace
there was no day of global unity
there was no day of intercultural cooperation
there was no day when humanity came together separate in all of those things and just shared it together that we 're in this together and that if we united and we interculturally cooperated then that might be the key to humanity 's survival
that might shift the level of consciousness around the fundamental issues that humanity faces if we did it just for a day
so obviously we didn 't have any money
i was living at my mom 's place
and we started writing letters to everybody
you very quickly work out what is it that you 've got to do to fathom that out
how do you create a day voted by every single head of state in the world to create the first ever ceasefire nonviolence day the 21st of september
and i wanted it to be the 21st of september because it was my granddad 's favorite number
he was a prisoner of war
he saw the bomb go off at nagasaki
it poisoned his blood he died when i was 11
so he was like my hero
and the reason why 21 was the number is 700 men left 23 came back two died on the boat and 21 hit the ground
and that 's why we wanted it to be the 21st of september as the date of peace
so we began this journey and we launched it in 1999
and we wrote to heads of state their ambassadors nobel peace laureates ngos faiths various organizations literally wrote to everybody
and very quickly some letters started coming back
and we started to build this case
and i remember the first letter
one of the first letters was from the dalai lama
and of course we didn 't have the money we were playing guitars and getting the money for the stamps that we were sending out all of [ this mail ]
a letter came through from the dalai lama saying this is an amazing thing come and see me
i 'd love to talk to you about the first ever day of peace
and we didn 't have money for the flight
and i rang sir bob ayling who was ceo of ba at the time and said mate we 've got this invitation
could you give me a flight because we 're going to go see him
and of course we went and saw him and it was amazing
and then dr. oscar arias came forward
and actually let me go back to that slide because when we launched it in 1999 this idea to create the first ever day of ceasefire and non-violence we invited thousands of people
well not thousands hundreds of people lots of people all the press because we were going to try and create the first ever world peace day a peace day
and we invited everybody and no press showed up
there were 114 people there they were mostly my friends and family
and that was kind of like the launch of this thing
but it didn 't matter because we were documenting and that was the thing
for me it was really about the process
it wasn 't about the end result
and that 's the beautiful thing about the camera
they used to say the pen is mightier than the sword i think the camera is
and just staying in the moment with it was a beautiful thing and really empowering actually
so anyway we began the journey
and here you see people like mary robinson i went to see in geneva
i 'm cutting my hair it 's getting short and long because every time i saw kofi annan i was so worried that he thought i was a hippie that i cut it and that was kind of what was going on
yeah i 'm not worried about it now
so mary robinson she said to me listen this is an idea whose time has come this must be created
kofi annan said this will be beneficial to my troops on the ground
the oau at the time led by salim ahmed salim said i must get the african countries involved
dr. oscar arias nobel peace laureate president now of costa rica said i 'll do everything that i can
so i went and saw amr moussa at the league of arab states
i met mandela at the arusha peace talks and so on and so on and so on while i was building the case to prove whether this idea would make sense
and then we were listening to the people we were documenting everywhere
76 countries in the last 12 years i 've visited
and i 've always spoken to women and children wherever i 've gone
i 've recorded 44,000 young people
i 've recorded about 900 hours of their thoughts
i 'm really clear about how young people feel when you talk to them about this idea of having a starting point for their actions for a more peaceful world through their poetry their art their literature their music their sport whatever it might be
and we were listening to everybody
and it was an incredibly thing working with the u.n.
and working with ngos and building this case
i felt that i was presenting a case on behalf of the global community to try and create this day
and the stronger the case and the more detailed it was the better chance we had of creating this day
and it was this stuff this where i actually was in the beginning kind of thinking no matter what happened it didn 't actually matter
it didn 't matter if it didn 't create a day of peace
the fact is that if i tried and it didn 't work then i could make a statement about how unwilling the global community is to unite until it was in somalia picking up that young girl
and this young child who 'd taken about an inch and a half out of her leg with no antiseptic and that young boy who was a child soldier who told me he 'd killed people he was about 12 these things made me realize that this was not a film that i could just stop
and that actually at that moment something happened to me which obviously made me go i 'm going to document
if this is the only film that i ever make i 'm going to document until this becomes a reality
because we 've got to stop we 've got to do something where we unite separate from all the politics and religion that as a young person is confusing me
i don 't know how to get involved in that process
and then on the seventh of september i was invited to new york
the costa rican government and the british government had put forward to the united nations general assembly with 54 co-sponsors the idea of the first ever ceasefire nonviolence day the 21st of september as a fixed calendar date and it was unanimously adopted by every head of state in the world
yeah but there were hundreds of individuals obviously who made that a reality
and thank you to all of them
that was an incredible moment
i was at the top of the general assembly just looking down into it and seeing it happen
and as i mentioned when it started we were at the globe and there was no press
and now i was thinking well the press it really going to hear this story
and suddenly we started to institutionalize this day
kofi annan invited me on the morning of september the 11th to do a press conference
and it was 8 00 am when i stood there
and i was waiting for him to come down and i knew that he was on his way
and obviously he never came down the statement was never made
the world was never told there was a day of global ceasefire and nonviolence
and it was obviously a tragic moment for the thousands of people who lost their lives there and then subsequently all over the world
it never happened
and i remember thinking this is exactly why actually we have to work even harder
and we have to make this day work
it 's been created nobody knows
but we have to continue this journey and we have to tell people and we have to prove it can work
and i left new york freaked but actually empowered
and i felt inspired by the possibilities that if it did then maybe we wouldn 't see things like that
i remember putting that film out and going to cynics
i was showing the film and i remember being in israel and getting it absolutely slaughtered by some guys having watched the film that it 's just a day of peace it doesn 't mean anything
it 's not going to work you 're not going to stop the fighting in afghanistan the taliban won 't listen etc etc
it 's just symbolism
and that was even worse than actually what had just happened in many ways because it couldn 't not work
i 'd spoken in somalia burundi gaza the west bank india sri lanka congo wherever it was and they 'd all tell me if you can create a window of opportunity we can move aid we can vaccinate children
children can lead their projects
they can unite they can come together if people would stop lives will be saved
that 's what i 'd heard
and i 'd heard that from the people who really understood what conflict was about
and so i went back to the united nations
i decided that i 'd continue filming and make another movie
and i went back to the u.n. for another couple of years
we started moving around the corridors of the u.n. system governments and ngos trying desperately to find somebody to come forward and have a go at it see if we could make it possible
and after lots and lots of meetings obviously i 'm delighted that this man ahmad fawzi one of my heroes and mentors really he managed to get unicef involved
and unicef god bless them they said okay we 'll have a go
and then unama became involved in afghanistan
it was historical could it work in afghanistan with unama and who and civil society etc etc etc
and i was getting it all on film and i was recording it and i was thinking this is it this is the possibility of it maybe working
but even if it doesn 't at least the door is open and there 's a chance
and so i went back to london and i went and saw this chap jude law
and i saw him because he was an actor i was an actor i had a connection to him because we needed to get to the press we needed this attraction we needed the media to be involved
because if we start pumping it up a bit maybe more people would listen and there 'd be more when we got into certain areas maybe there would be more people interested
and maybe we 'd be helped financially a little bit more which had been desperately difficult
i won 't go into that
so jude said okay i 'll do some statements for you
while i was filming these statements he said to me where are you going next
i said i 'm going to go to afghanistan he said really
and i could sort of see a little look in his eye of interest
so i said to him do you want to come with me
it 'd be really interesting if you came
it would help and bring attention
and that attention would help leverage the situation as well as all of the other sides of it
i think there 's a number of pillars to success
one is you 've got to have a great idea
the other is you 've got to have a constituency you 've got to have finance and you 've got to be able to raise awareness
and actually i could never raise awareness by myself no matter what i 'd achieved
so these guys were absolutely crucial
so he said yes and we found ourselves in afghanistan
it was a really incredible thing that when we landed there i was talking to various people and they were saying to me you 've got to get everybody involved here
you can 't just expect it to work you have to get out and work
and we did and we traveled around and we spoke to elders we spoke to doctors we spoke to nurses we held press conferences we went out with soldiers we sat down with isaf we sat down with nato we sat down with the u.k. government
i mean we basically sat down with everybody in and out of schools with ministers of education holding these press conferences which of course now were loaded with press everybody was there
there was an interest in what was going on
this amazing woman fatima gailani was absolutely instrumental in what went on as she was the spokesperson for the resistance against the russians
and her afghan network was just absolutely everywhere
and she was really crucial in getting the message in
and then we went home we 'd sort of done it
we had to wait now and see what happened
and i got home and i remember one of the team bringing in a letter to me from the taliban
and that letter basically said we 'll observe this day
we will observe this day
we see it as a window of opportunity
and we will not engage we 're not going to engage
and that meant that humanitarian workers wouldn 't be kidnapped or killed
and then suddenly i obviously knew at this point there was a chance
and days later 1.6 million children were vaccinated against polio as a consequence of everybody stopping
and like the general assembly obviously the most wonderful wonderful moment
and so then we wrapped the film up and we put it together because we had to go back
we put it into dari and pashto we put it in the local dialects
we went back to afghanistan because the next year was coming and we wanted to support
but more importantly we wanted to go back because these people in afghanistan were the heroes
they were the people who believed in peace and the possibilities of it etc etc and they made it real
and we wanted to go back and show them the film and say look you guys made this possible and thank you very much
and we gave the film over
obviously it was shown and it was amazing
and then that year that year 2008 this isaf statement from kabul afghanistan september 17th general stanley mcchrystal commander of international security assistance forces in afghanistan announced today isaf will not conduct offensive military operations on the 21st of september
they were saying they would stop
and then there was this other statement that came out from the u.n. department of security and safety saying that in afghanistan because of this work the violence was down by 70 percent
70 percent reduction in violence on this day at least
and that completely blew my mind almost more than anything
and i remember being stuck in new york this time because of the volcano which was obviously much less harmful
and i was there thinking about what was going on
and i kept thinking about this 70 percent
70 percent reduction in violence in what everyone said was completely impossible and you couldn 't do
and that made me think that if we can get 70 percent in afghanistan then surely we can get 70 percent reduction everywhere
we have to go for a global truce
we have to utilize this day of ceasefire and nonviolence and go for a global truce go for the largest recorded cessation of hostilities both domestically and internationally ever recorded
that 's exactly what we must do
and on the 21st of september this year we 're going to launch that campaign at the o2 arena to go for that process to try and create the largest recorded cessation of hostilities
and we will utilize all kinds of things have a dance and social media and visiting on facebook and visit the website sign the petition
and it 's in the six official languages of the united nations
and we 'll globally link with government inter-government non-government education unions sports
and you can see the education box there
we 've got resources at the moment in 174 countries trying to get young people to be the driving force behind the vision of that global truce
and obviously the life-saving is increased the concepts help
linking up with the olympics i went and saw seb coe i said london 2012 is about truce
ultimately that 's what it 's about
why don 't we all team up why don 't we bring truce to life
why don 't you support the process of the largest ever global truce
we 'll make a new film about this process
we 'll utilize sport and football
on the day of peace there 's thousands of football matches all played from the favelas of brazil to wherever it might be
so utilizing all of these ways to inspire individual action
and ultimately we have to try that
we have to work together
and when i stand here in front of all of you and the people who will watch these things i 'm excited on behalf of everybody i 've met that there is a possibility that our world could unite that we could come together as one that we could lift the level of consciousness around the fundamental issues brought about by individuals
i was with brahimi ambassador brahimi
i think he 's one of the most incredible men in relation to international politics in afghanistan in iraq
he 's an amazing man
and i sat with him a few weeks ago
and i said to him mr. brahimi is this nuts going for a global truce
is this possible is it really possible that we could do this
he said it 's absolutely possible
i said what would you do
would you go to governments and lobby and use the system
he said no i 'd talk to the individuals
it 's all about the individuals
it 's all about you and me
it 's all about partnerships
it 's about your constituencies it 's about your businesses
because together by working together i seriously think we can start to change things
and there 's a wonderful man sitting in this audience and i don 't know where he is who said to me a few days ago because i did a little rehearsal and he said i 've been thinking about this day and imagining it as a square with 365 squares and one of them is white
and it then made me think about a glass of water which is clear
if you put one drop one drop of something in that water it 'll change it forever
by working together we can create peace one day
thank you ted thank you
thank you
thanks a lot
thank you very much thank you
one of my favorite parts of my job at the gates foundation is that i get to travel to the developing world and i do that quite regularly
and when i meet the mothers in so many of these remote places i 'm really struck by the things that we have in common
they want what we want for our children and that is for their children to grow up successful to be healthy and to have a successful life
but i also see lots of poverty and it 's quite jarring both in the scale and the scope of it
my first trip in india i was in a person 's home where they had dirt floors no running water no electricity and that 's really what i see all over the world
so in short i 'm startled by all the things that they don 't have
but i am surprised by one thing that they do have coca-cola
coke is everywhere
in fact when i travel to the developing world coke feels ubiquitous
and so when i come back from these trips and i 'm thinking about development and i 'm flying home and i 'm thinking we 're trying to deliver condoms to people or vaccinations you know coke 's success kind of stops and makes you wonder how is it that they can get coke to these far-flung places
if they can do that why can 't governments and ngos do the same thing
and i 'm not the first person to ask this question
but i think as a community we still have a lot to learn
it 's staggering if you think about coca-cola
they sell 1.5 billion servings every single day
that 's like every man woman and child on the planet having a serving of coke every week
so why does this matter
well if we 're going to speed up the progress and go even faster on the set of millennium development goals that we 're set as a world we need to learn from the innovators and those innovators come from every single sector
i feel that if we can understand what makes something like coca-cola ubiquitous we can apply those lessons then for the public good
coke 's success is relevant because if we can analyze it learn from it then we can save lives
so that 's why i took a bit of time to study coke
and i think there are really three things we can take away from coca-cola
they take real-time data and immediately feed it back into the product
they tap into local entrepreneurial talent and they do incredible marketing
so let 's start with the data
now coke has a very clear bottom line they report to a set of shareholders they have to turn a profit
so they take the data and they use it to measure progress
they have this very continuous feedback loop
they learn something they put it back into the product they put it back into the market
they have a whole team called knowledge and insight
it 's a lot like other consumer companies
so if you 're running namibia for coca-cola and you have a 107 constituencies you know where every can versus bottle of sprite fanta or coke was sold whether it was a corner store a supermarket or a pushcart
so if sales start to drop then the person can identify the problem and address the issue
let 's contrast that for a minute to development
in development the evaluation comes at the very end of the project
i 've sat in a lot of those meetings and by then it is way too late to use the data
i had somebody from an ngo once describe it to me as bowling in the dark
they said you roll the ball you hear some pins go down
it 's dark you can 't see which one goes down until the lights come on and then you an see your impact
real-time data turns on the lights
so what 's the second thing that coke 's good at
they 're good at tapping into that local entrepreneurial talent
coke 's been in africa since 1928 but most of the time they couldn 't reach the distant markets because they had a system that was a lot like in the developed world which was a large truck rolling down the street
and in africa the remote places it 's hard to find a good road
but coke noticed something they noticed that local people were taking the product buying it in bulk and then reselling it in these hard-to-reach places
and so they took a bit of time to learn about that
and they decided in 1990 that they wanted to start training the local entrepreneurs giving them small loans
they set them up as what they called micro-distribution centers and those local entrepreneurs then hire sales people who go out with bicycles and pushcarts and wheelbarrows to sell the product
there are now some 3,000 of these centers employing about 15,000 people in africa
in tanzania and uganda they represent 90 percent of coke 's sales
let 's look at the development side
what is it that governments and ngos can learn from coke
governments and ngos need to tap into that local entrepreneurial talent as well because the locals know how to reach the very hard-to-serve places their neighbors and they know what motivates them to make change
i think a great example of this is ethiopia 's new health extension program
the government noticed in ethiopia that many of the people were so far away from a health clinic they were over a day 's travel away from a health clinic
so if you 're in an emergency situation or if you 're a mom about to deliver a baby forget it to get to the health care center
they decided that wasn 't good enough so they went to india and studied the indian state of kerala that also had a system like this and they adapted it for ethiopia
and in 2003 the government of ethiopia started this new system in their own country
they trained 35,000 health extension workers to deliver care directly to the people
in just five years their ratio went from one worker for every 30,000 people to one worker for every 2,500 people
now think about how this can change people 's lives
health extension workers can help with so many things whether it 's family planning prenatal care immunizations for the children or advising the woman to get to the facility on time for an on-time delivery
that is having real impact in a country like ethiopia and it 's why you see their child mortality numbers coming down 25 percent from 2000 to 2008
in ethiopia there are hundreds of thousands of children living because of this health extension worker program
so what 's the next step for ethiopia
well they 're already starting talk about this
they 're starting to talk about how do you have the health community workers generate their own ideas
how do you incent them based on the impact that they 're getting out in those remote villages
that 's how you tap into local entrepreneurial talent and you unlock people 's potential
the third component of coke 's success is marketing
ultimately coke 's success depends on one crucial fact and that is that people want a coca-cola
now the reason these micro-entrepreneurs can sell or make a profit is they have to sell every single bottle in their pushcart or their wheelbarrow
so they rely on coca-cola in terms of its marketing and what 's the secret to their marketing
well it 's aspirational
it is associated that product with a kind of life that people want to live
so even though it 's a global company they take a very local approach
coke 's global campaign slogan is open happiness
but they localize it
and they don 't just guess what makes people happy they go to places like latin america and they realize that happiness there is associated with family life
and in south africa they associate happiness with seriti or community respect
now that played itself out in the world cup campaign
let 's listen to this song that coke created for it wavin flag by a somali hip hop artist
k 'naan oh oh oh oh oh o-oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh o-oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh o-oh give you freedom give you fire give you reason take you higher see the champions take the field now you define us make us feel proud in the streets our heads are lifted as we lose our inhibition celebration it 's around us every nation all around us melinda french gates it feels pretty good right
well they didn 't stop there they localized it into 18 different languages
and it went number one on the pop chart in 17 countries
it reminds me of a song that i remember from my childhood i 'd like to teach the world to sing that also went number one on the pop charts
both songs have something in common that same appeal of celebration and unity
so how does health and development market
well it 's based on avoidance not aspirations
i 'm sure you 've heard some of these messages
use a condom don 't get aids
wash you hands you might not get diarrhea
it doesn 't sound anything like wavin flag to me
and i think we make a fundamental mistake we make an assumption that we think that if people need something we don 't have to make them want that
and i think that 's a mistake
and there 's some indications around the world that this is starting to change
one example is sanitation
we know that a million and a half children die a year from diarrhea and a lot of it is because of open defecation
but there 's a solution you build a toilet
but what we 're finding around the world over and over again is if you build a toilet and you leave it there it doesn 't get used
people reuse it for a slab for their home
they sometimes store grain in it
i 've even seen it used for a chicken coop
but what does marketing really entail that would make a sanitation solution get a result in diarrhea
well you work with the community
you start to talk to them about why open defecation is something that shouldn 't be done in the village and they agree to that
but then you take the toilet and you position it as a modern trendy convenience
one state in northern india has gone so far as to link toilets to courtship
and it works look at these headlines
i 'm not kidding
women are refusing to marry men without toilets
no loo no i do
now it 's not just a funny headline it 's innovative it 's an innovative marketing campaign
but more importantly it saves lives
take a look at this this is a room full of young men and my husband bill
and can you guess what the young men are waiting for
they 're waiting to be circumcised
can you you believe that
we know that circumcision reduces hiv infection by 60 percent in men
and when we first heard this result inside the foundation i have to admit bill and i were scratching our heads a little bit and we were saying but who 's going to volunteer for this procedure
but it turns out the men do because they 're hearing from their girlfriends that they prefer it and the men also believe it improves their sex life
so if we can start to understand what people really want in health and development we can change communities and we can change whole nations
well why is all of this so important
so let 's talk about what happens when this all comes together when you tie the three things together
and polio i think is one of the most powerful examples
we 've seen a 99 percent reduction in polio in 20 years
so if you look back to 1988 there are about 350,000 cases of polio on the planet that year
in 2009 we 're down to 1,600 cases
well how did that happen
let 's look at a country like india
they have over a billion people in this country but they have 35,000 local doctors who report paralysis and clinicians a huge reporting system in chemists
they have two and a half million vaccinators
but let me make the story a little bit more concrete for you
let me tell you the story of shriram an 18 month boy in bihar a northern state in india
this year on august 8th he felt paralysis and on the 13th his parents took him to the doctor
on august 14th and 15th they took a stool sample and by the 25th of august it was confirmed he had type 1 polio
by august 30th a genetic test was done and we knew what strain of polio shriram had
now it could have come from one of two places
it could have come from nepal just to the north across the border or from jharkhand a state just to the south
luckily the genetic testing proved that in fact this strand came north because had it come from the south it would have had a much wider impact in terms of transmission
so many more people would have been affected
so what 's the endgame
well on september 4th there was a huge mop-up campaign which is what you do in polio
they went out and where shriram lives they vaccinated two million people
so in less than a month we went from one case of paralysis to a targeted vaccination program
and i 'm happy to say only one other person in that area got polio
that 's how you keep a huge outbreak from spreading and it shows what can happen when local people have the data in their hands they can save lives
now one of the challenges in polio still is marketing but it might not be what you think
it 's not the marketing on the ground
it 's not telling the parents if you see paralysis take your child to the doctor or get your child vaccinated
we have a problem with marketing in the donor community
the g8 nations have been incredibly generous on polio over the last 20 years but we 're starting to have something called polio fatigue and that is that the donor nations aren 't willing to fund polio any longer
so by next summer we 're sighted to run out of money on polio
so we are 99 percent of the way there on this goal and we 're about to run short of money
and i think that if the marketing were more aspirational if we could focus as a community on how far we 've come and how amazing it would be to eradicate this disease we could put polio fatigue and polio behind us
and if we could do that we could stop vaccinating everybody worldwide in all of our countries for polio
and it would only be the second disease ever wiped off the face of the planet
and we are so close
and this victory is so possible
so if coke 's marketers came to me and asked me to define happiness i 'd say my vision of happiness is a mother holding healthy baby in her arms
to me that is deep happiness
and so if we can learn lessons from the innovators in every sector then in the future we make together that happiness can be just as ubiquitous as coca-cola
thank you

the allosphere it 's a three-story metal sphere in an echo-free chamber
think of the allosphere as a large dynamically varying digital microscope that 's connected to a supercomputer
20 researchers can stand on a bridge suspended inside of the sphere and be completely immersed in their data
imagine if a team of physicists could stand inside of an atom and watch and hear electrons spin
imagine if a group of sculptors could be inside of a lattice of atoms and sculpt with their material
imagine if a team of surgeons could fly into the brain as though it was a world and see tissues as landscapes and hear blood density levels as music
this is some of the research that you 're going to see that we 're undertaking at the allosphere
but first a little bit about this group of artists scientists and engineers that are working together
i 'm a composer orchestrally-trained and the inventor of the allosphere
with my visual artist colleagues we map complex mathematical algorithms that unfold in time and space visually and sonically
our scientist colleagues are finding new patterns in the information
and our engineering colleagues are making one of the largest dynamically varying computers in the world for this kind of data exploration
i 'm going to fly you into five research projects in the allosphere that are going to take you from biological macroscopic data all the way down to electron spin
this first project is called the allobrain
and it 's our attempt to quantify beauty by finding which regions of the brain are interactive while witnessing something beautiful
you 're flying through the cortex of my colleague 's brain
our narrative here is real fmri data that 's mapped visually and sonically
the brain now a world that we can fly through and interact with
you see 12 intelligent computer agents the little rectangles that are flying in the brain with you
they 're mining blood density levels
and they 're reporting them back to you sonically
higher density levels mean more activity in that point of the brain
they 're actually singing these densities to you with higher pitches mapped to higher densities
we 're now going to move from real biological data to biogenerative algorithms that create artificial nature in our next artistic and scientific installation
in this artistic and scientific installation biogenerative algorithms are helping us to understand self-generation and growth very important for simulation in the nanoscaled sciences
for artists we 're making new worlds that we can uncover and explore
these generative algorithms grow over time and they interact and communicate as a swarm of insects
our researchers are interacting with this data by injecting bacterial code which are computer programs that allow these creatures to grow over time
we 're going to move now from the biological and the macroscopic world down into the atomic world as we fly into a lattice of atoms
this is real afm atomic force microscope data from my colleagues in the solid state lighting and energy center
they 've discovered a new bond a new material for transparent solar cells
we 're flying through 2,000 lattice of atoms oxygen hydrogen and zinc
you view the bond in the triangle
it 's four blue zinc atoms bonding with one white hydrogen atom
you see the electron flow with the streamlines we as artists have generated for the scientists
this is allowing them to find the bonding nodes in any lattice of atoms
we think it makes a beautiful structural art
the sound that you 're hearing are the actual emission spectrums of these atoms
we 've mapped them into the audio domain so they 're singing to you
oxygen hydrogen and zinc have their own signature
we 're going to actually move even further down as we go from this lattice of atoms to one single hydrogen atom
we 're working with our physicist colleagues that have given us the mathematical calculations of the n-dimensional schrödinger equation in time
what you 're seeing here right now is a superposition of an electron in the lower three orbitals of a hydrogen atom
you 're actually hearing and seeing the electron flow with the lines
the white dots are the probability wave that will show you where the electron is in any given point of time and space in this particular three-orbital configuration
in a minute we 're going to move to a two-orbital configuration and you 're going to notice a pulsing
and you 're going to hear an undulation between the sound
this is actually a light emitter
as the sound starts to pulse and contract our physicists can tell when a photon is going to be emitted
they 're starting to find new mathematical structures in these calculations
and they 're understanding more about quantum mathematics
we 're going to move even further down and go to one single electron spin
this will be the final project that i show you
our colleagues in the center for quantum computation and spintronics are actually measuring with their lasers decoherence in a single electron spin
we 've taken this information and we 've made a mathematical model out of it
you 're actually seeing and hearing quantum information flow
this is very important for the next step in simulating quantum computers and information technology
so these brief examples that i 've shown you give you an idea of the kind of work that we 're doing at the university of california santa barbara to bring together arts science and engineering into a new age of math science and art
we hope that all of you will come to see the allosphere
inspire us to think of new ways that we can use this unique instrument that we 've created at santa barbara
thank you very much
i essentially drag sledges for a living so it doesn 't take an awful lot to flummox me intellectually but i 'm going to read this question from an interview earlier this year philosophically does the constant supply of information steal our ability to imagine or replace our dreams of achieving
after all if it is being done somewhere by someone and we can participate virtually then why bother leaving the house
i 'm usually introduced as a polar explorer
i 'm not sure that 's the most progressive or 21st-century of job titles but i 've spent more than two percent now of my entire life living in a tent inside the arctic circle so i get out of the house a fair bit
and in my nature i guess i am a doer of things more than i am a spectator or a contemplator of things and it 's that dichotomy the gulf between ideas and action that i 'm going to try and explore briefly
the pithiest answer to the question why
that 's been dogging me for the last 12 years was credited certainly to this chap the rakish-looking gentleman standing at the back second from the left george lee mallory many of you will know his name
in 1924 he was last seen disappearing into the clouds near the summit of mt everest
he may or may not have been the first person to climb everest more than 30 years before edmund hillary
no one knows if he got to the top it 's still a mystery
but he was credited with coining the phrase because it 's there
now i 'm not actually sure that he did say that
there 's very little evidence to suggest it but what he did say is actually far nicer and again i 've printed this i 'm going to read it out
the first question which you will ask and which i must try to answer is this what is the use of climbing mt everest
and my answer must at once be it is no use
there is not the slightest prospect of any gain whatsoever
oh we may learn a little about the behavior of the human body at high altitudes and possibly medical men may turn our observation to some account for the purposes of aviation but otherwise nothing will come of it
we shall not bring back a single bit of gold or silver and not a gem nor any coal or iron
we shall not find a single foot of earth that can be planted with crops to raise food so it is no use
if you cannot understand that there is something in man which responds to the challenge of this mountain and goes out to meet it that the struggle is the struggle of life itself upward and forever upward then you won 't see why we go
what we get from this adventure is just sheer joy and joy after all is the end of life
we don 't live to eat and make money
we eat and make money to be able to enjoy life
that is what life means and that is what life is for
mallory 's argument that leaving the house embarking on these grand adventures is joyful and fun however doesn 't tally that neatly with my own experience
the furthest i 've ever got away from my front door was in the spring of 2004 i still don 't know exactly what came over me but my plan was to make a solo and unsupported crossing of the arctic ocean
i planned essentially to walk from the north coast of russia to the north pole and then to carry on to the north coast of canada
no one had ever done this i was 26 at the time
a lot of experts were saying it was impossible and my mum certainly wasn 't very keen on the idea
the journey from a small weather station on the north coast of siberia up to my final starting point the edge of the pack ice the coast of the arctic ocean took about five hours and if anyone watched fearless felix baumgartner going up rather than just coming down you 'll appreciate the sense of apprehension as i sat in a helicopter thundering north and the sense i think if anything of impending doom
i sat there wondering what on earth i had gotten myself into
there was a bit of fun a bit of joy
i was 26 i remember sitting there looking down at my sledge i had my skis ready to go i had a satellite phone a pump-action shotgun in case i was attacked by a polar bear
i remember looking out of the window and seeing the second helicopter
we were both thundering through this incredible siberian dawn and part of me felt a bit like a cross between jason bourne and wilfred thesiger part of me felt quite proud of myself but mostly i was just utterly terrified
and that journey lasted 10 weeks 72 days
i didn 't see anyone else we took this photo next to the helicopter
beyond that i didn 't see anyone for 10 weeks
the north pole is slap bang in the middle of the sea so i 'm traveling over the frozen surface of the arctic ocean
nasa described conditions that year as the worst since records began
i was dragging 180 kilos of food and fuel and supplies about 400 pounds the average temperature for the 10 weeks was minus 35 minus 50 was the coldest
so again there wasn 't an awful lot of joy or fun to be had
one of the magical things about this journey however is that because i 'm walking over the sea over this floating drifting shifting crust of ice that 's floating on top of the arctic ocean is it 's an environment that 's in a constant state of flux
the ice is always moving breaking up drifting around refreezing so the scenery that i saw for nearly 3 months was unique to me no one else will ever could ever possibly see the views the vistas that i saw for 10 weeks
and that i guess is probably the finest argument for leaving the house
i can try to tell you what it was like but you 'll never know what it was like and the more i try to explain that i felt lonely i was the only human being in 5.4 million square-miles it was cold nearly minus 75 with windchill on a bad day the more words fall short and i 'm unable to do it justice
and it seems to me therefore that the doing you know to try to experience to engage to endeavor rather than to watch and to wonder that 's where the real meat of life is to be found the juice that we can suck out of our hours and days
and i would add a cautionary note here however
in my experience there is something addictive about tasting life at the very edge of what 's humanly possible
now i don 't just mean in the field of daft macho edwardian style derring-do but also in the fields of pancreatic cancer there is something addictive about this and in my case i think polar expeditions are perhaps not that far removed from having a crack habit
i can 't explain quite how good it is until you 've tried it but it has the capacity to burn up all the money i can get my hands on to ruin every relationship i 've ever had so be careful what you wish for
mallory postulated that there is something in man that responds to the challenge of the mountain and i wonder if that 's the case whether there 's something in the challenge itself in the endeavor and particularly in the big unfinished chunky challenges that face humanity that call out to us and in my experience that 's certainly the case
there is one unfinished challenge that 's been calling out to me for most of my adult life
many of you will know the story
this is a photo of captain scott and his team
scott set out just over a hundred years ago to try to become the first person to reach the south pole
no one knew what was there it was utterly unmapped at the time we knew more about the surface of the moon than we did about the heart of antarctica
scott as many of you will know was beaten to it by roald amundsen and his norwegian team who used dogs and dogsleds scott 's team were on foot all five of them wearing harnesses and dragging around sledges and they arrived at the pole to find the norwegian flag already there i 'd imagine pretty bitter and demoralized
all five of them turned and started walking back to the coast and all five died on that return journey
there is a sort of misconception nowadays that it 's all been done in the fields of exploration and adventure
when i talk about antarctica people often say hasn 't you know that 's interesting hasn 't that blue peter presenter just done it on a bike
or that 's nice you know my grandmother 's going on a cruise to antarctica next year you know
is there a chance you 'll see her there
but scott 's journey remains unfinished
no one has ever walked from the very coast of antarctica to the south pole and back again
it is arguably the most audacious endeavor of that edwardian golden age of exploration and it seemed to me high time given everything we have figured out in the century since from scurvy to solar panels that it was high time someone had a go at finishing the job
so that 's precisely what i 'm setting out to do
this time next year in october i 'm leading a team of three
it will take us about four months to make this return journey
that 's the scale the red line is obviously halfway to the pole
we have to turn around and come back again
i 'm well aware of the irony of telling you that we will be blogging and tweeting you 'll be able to live vicariously and virtually through this journey in a way that no one has ever before
and it 'll also be a four-month chance for me to finally come up with a pithy answer to the question why
and our lives today are safer and more comfortable than they have ever been there certainly isn 't much call for explorers nowadays my career advisor at school never mentioned it as an option
if i wanted to know for example how many stars were in the milky way how old those giant heads on easter island were most of you could find that out right now without even standing up
and yet if i 've learned anything in nearly 12 years now of dragging heavy things around cold places it is that true real inspiration and growth only comes from adversity and from challenge from stepping away from what 's comfortable and familiar and stepping out into the unknown
in life we all have tempests to ride and poles to walk to and i think metaphorically speaking at least we could all benefit from getting outside the house a little more often if only we could summon up the courage
i certainly would implore you to open the door just a little bit and take a look at what 's outside
thank you very much
about four years ago the new yorker published an article about a cache of dodo bones that was found in a pit on the island of mauritius
now the island of mauritius is a small island off the east coast of madagascar in the indian ocean and it is the place where the dodo bird was discovered and extinguished all within about 150 years
everyone was very excited about this archaeological find because it meant that they might finally be able to assemble a single dodo skeleton
see while museums all over the world have dodo skeletons in their collection nobody not even the actual natural history museum on the island of mauritius has a skeleton that 's made from the bones of a single dodo
well this isn 't exactly true
the fact is is that the british museum had a complete specimen of a dodo in their collection up until the 18th century it was actually mummified skin and all but in a fit of space-saving zeal they actually cut off the head and they cut off the feet and they burned the rest in a bonfire
if you go look at their website today they 'll actually list these specimens saying the rest was lost in a fire
not quite the whole truth anyway
the frontispiece of this article was this photo and i 'm one of the people that thinks that tina brown was great for bringing photos to the new yorker because this photo completely rocked my world
i became obsessed with the object not just the beautiful photograph itself and the color the shallow depth of field the detail that 's visible the wire you can see on the beak there that the conservator used to put this skeleton together there 's an entire story here
and i thought to myself wouldn 't it be great if i had my own dodo skeleton
i want to point out here at this point that i 've spent my life obsessed by objects and the stories that they tell and this was the very latest one
so i began looking around for to see if anyone sold a kit some kind of model that i could get and i found lots of reference material lots of lovely pictures
no dice no dodo skeleton for me but the damage had been done
i had saved a few hundred photos of dodo skeletons into my creative projects folder it 's a repository for my brain everything that i could possibly be interested in
any time i have an internet connection there 's a sluice of stuff moving into there everything from beautiful rings to cockpit photos
the key that the marquis du lafayette sent to george washington to celebrate the storming of the bastille
russian nuclear launch key the one on the top is the picture of the one i found on ebay the one on the bottom is the one i made for myself because i couldn 't afford the one on ebay
storm trooper costumes maps of middle earth that 's one i hand-drew myself there 's the dodo skeleton folder
this folder has 17,000 photos over 20 gigabytes of information and it 's growing constantly
and one day a couple of weeks later it might have been maybe a year later i was in the art store with my kids and i was buying some clay tools we were going to have a craft day
i bought some super sculpeys some armature wire some various materials
and i looked down at this sculpey and i thought maybe yeah maybe i could make my own dodo skull
i should point out at this time i 'm not a sculptor i 'm a hard-edged model maker
you give me a drawing you give me a prop to replicate you give me a crane scaffolding parts from star wars especially parts from star wars i can do this stuff all day long
it 's exactly how i made my living for 15 years
but you give me something like this my friend mike murnane sculpted this it 's a maquette for star wars episode two this is not my thing this is something other people do dragons soft things
however i felt like i had looked at enough photos of dodo skulls to actually be able to understand the topology and perhaps replicate it i mean it couldn 't be that difficult
so i started looking at the best photos i could find
i grabbed all the reference and i found this lovely piece of reference
this is someone selling this on ebay it was clearly a woman 's hand hopefully a woman 's hand
assuming it was roughly the size of my wife 's hand i made some measurements of her thumb and i scaled them out to the size of the skull
i blew it up to the actual size and i began using that along with all the other reference that i had comparing it to it as size reference for figuring out exactly how big the beak should be exactly how long etc
and over a few hours i eventually achieved what was actually a pretty reasonable dodo skull and i didn 't mean to continue i it 's kind of like you know you can only clean a super messy room by picking up one thing at a time you can 't think about the totality
i wasn 't thinking about a dodo skeleton i just noticed that as i finished this skull the armature wire that i had been used to holding it up was sticking out of the back just where a spine would be
and one of the other things i 'd been interested in and obsessed with over the years is spines and skeletons having collected a couple of hundred
i actually understood the mechanics of vertebrae enough to kind of start to imitate them
and so button by button vertebrae by vertebrae i built my way down
and actually by the end of the day i had a reasonable skull a moderately good vertebrae and half of a pelvis
and again i kept on going looking for more reference every bit of reference i could find drawings beautiful photos
this guy i love this guy he put a dodo leg bones on a scanner with a ruler
this is the kind of accuracy that i wanted and i replicated every last bone and put it in
and after about six weeks i finished painted mounted my own dodo skeleton
you can see that i even made a museum label for it that includes a brief history of the dodo
and tap plastics made me although i didn 't photograph it a museum vitrine
i don 't have the room for this in my house but i had to finish what i had started
and this actually represented kind of a sea change to me
again like i said my life has been about being fascinated by objects and the stories that they tell and also making them for myself obtaining them appreciating them and diving into them
and in this folder creative projects there are tons of projects that i 'm currently working on projects that i 've already worked on things that i might want to work on some day and things that i may just want to find and buy and have and look at and touch
but now there was potentially this new category of things that i could sculpt that was different that i you know i have my own r2d2 but that 's honestly relative to sculpting to me that 's easy
and so i went back and looked through my creative projects folder and i happened across the maltese falcon
now this is funny for me to fall in love with an object from a hammett novel because if it 's true that the world is divided into two types of people chandler people and hammett people i am absolutely a chandler person
but in this case it 's not about the author it 's not about the book or the movie or the story it 's about the object in and of itself
and in this case this object is plays on a host of levels
first of all there 's the object in the world
this is the kniphausen hawk
it is a ceremonial pouring vessel made around 1700 for a swedish count and it is very likely the object from which hammett drew his inspiration for the maltese falcon
then there is the fictional bird the one that hammett created for the book
built out of words it is the engine that drives the plot of his book and also the movie in which another object is created a prop that has to represent the thing that hammett created out of words inspired by the kniphausen hawk and this represents the falcon in the movie
and then there is this fourth level which is a whole new object in the world the prop made for the movie the representative of the thing becomes in its own right a whole other thing a whole new object of desire
and so now it was time to do some research
i actually had done some research a few years before it 's why the folder was there
i 'd bought a replica a really crappy replica of the maltese falcon on ebay and had downloaded enough pictures to actually have some reasonable reference
but i discovered in researching further really wanting precise reference that one of the original lead birds had been sold at christie 's in 1994 and so i contacted an antiquarian bookseller who had the original christie 's catalogue and in it i found this magnificent picture which included a size reference
i was able to scan the picture blow it up to exactly full size
i found other reference avi [ ara ] chekmayan a new jersey editor actually found this resin maltese falcon at a flea market in 1991 although it took him five years to authenticate this bird to the auctioneers specifications because there was a lot of controversy about it
it was made out of resin which wasn 't a common material for movie props about the time the movie was made
it 's funny to me that it took a while to authenticate it because i can see it compared to this thing and i can tell you it 's real it 's the real thing it 's made from the exact same mold that this one is
in this one because the auction was actually so controversial profiles in history the auction house that sold this i think in 1995 for about 100,000 dollars they actually included you can see here on the bottom not just a front elevation but also a side rear and other side elevation
so now i had all the topology i needed to replicate the maltese falcon
what do they do how do you start something like that i really don 't know
so what i did was again like i did with the dodo skull i blew all my reference up to full size and then i began cutting out the negatives and using those templates as shape references
so i took sculpey and i built a big block of it and i passed it through until you know i got the right profiles
and then slowly feather by feather detail by detail i worked out and achieved working in front of the television and super sculpey here 's me sitting next to my wife it 's the only picture i took of the entire process
as i moved through i achieved a very reasonable facsimile of the maltese falcon
but again i am not a sculptor and so i don 't know a lot of the tricks like i don 't know how my friend mike gets beautiful shiny surfaces with his sculpey i certainly wasn 't able to get it
so i went down to my shop and i molded it and i cast it in resin because in the resin then i could absolutely get the glass smooth finished
now there 's a lot of ways to fill and get yourself a nice smooth finish
my preference is about 70 coats of this matte black auto primer
i spray it on for about three or four days it drips to hell but it allows me a really really nice gentle sanding surface and i can get it glass-smooth
oh finishing up with triple-zero steel wool
now the great thing about getting it to this point was that because in the movie when they finally bring out the bird at the end and they place it on the table they actually spin it
so i was able to actually screen-shot and freeze-frame to make sure
and i 'm following all the light kicks on this thing and making sure that as i 'm holding the light in the same position i 'm getting the same type of reflection on it that 's the level of detail i 'm going into this thing
i ended up with this my maltese falcon
and it 's beautiful and i can state with authority at this point in time when i 'd finished it of all of the replicas out there and there is a few this is by far the most accurate representation of the original maltese falcon than anyone has sculpted now the original one i should tell you is sculpted by a guy named fred sexton
this is where it gets weird
fred sexton was a friend of this guy george hodel
terrifying guy agreed by many to be the killer of the black dahlia
now james ellroy believes that fred sexton the sculptor of the maltese falcon killed james elroy 's mother
i 'll go you one stranger than that in 1974 during the production of a weird comedy sequel to the maltese falcon called the black bird starring george segal the los angeles county museum of art had a plaster original of the maltese falcon one of the original six plasters i think made for the movie stolen out of the museum a lot of people thought it was a publicity stunt for the movie
john 's grill which actually is seen briefly in the maltese falcon is still a viable san francisco eatery counted amongst its regular customers elisha cook who played wilmer cook in the movie and he gave them one of his original plasters of the maltese falcon
and they had it in their cabinet for about 15 years until it got stolen in january of 2007
it would seem that the object of desire only comes into its own by disappearing repeatedly
so here i had this falcon and it was lovely it looked really great the light worked on it really well it was better than anything that i could achieve or obtain out in the world
but there was a problem and the problem was that i wanted the entirety of the object i wanted the weight behind the object
this thing was made of resin and it was too light
there 's this group online that i frequent
it 's a group of prop crazies just like me called the replica props forum and it 's people who trade make and travel in information about movie props
and it turned out that one of the guys there a friend of mine that i never actually met but befriended through some prop deals was the manager of a local foundry
he took my master falcon pattern he actually did lost wax casting in bronze for me and this is the bronze i got back
and this is after some acid etching the one that i ended up with
and this thing it 's deeply deeply satisfying to me
here i 'm going to put it out there later on tonight and i want you to pick it up and handle it
you want to know how obsessed i am this project 's only for me and yet i went so far as to buy on ebay a 1941 chinese san francisco-based newspaper in order so that the bird could properly be wrapped ...
like it is in the movie
yeah i know
there you can see it 's weighing in at 27 and a half pounds
that 's half the weight of my dog huxley
but there 's a problem
now here 's the most recent progression of falcons
on the far left is a piece of crap a replica i bought on ebay
there 's my somewhat ruined sculpey falcon because i had to get it back out of the mold there 's my first casting there 's my master and there 's my bronze
there 's a thing that happens when you mold and cast things which is that every time you throw it into silicone and cast it in resin you lose a little bit of volume you lose a little bit of size
and when i held my bronze one up against my sculpey one it was shorter by three-quarters of an inch
yeah no really this was like aah why didn 't i remember this
why didn 't i start and make it bigger
so what do i do i figure i have two options
one i can fire a freaking laser at it which i have already done to do a 3d scan there 's a 3d scan of this falcon
i had figured out the exact amount of shrinkage i achieved going from a wax master to a bronze master and blown this up big enough to make a 3d lithography master of this which i will polish then i will send to the mold maker and then i will have it done in bronze or there are several people who own originals and i have been attempting to contact them and reach them hoping that they will let me spend a few minutes in the presence of one of the real birds maybe to take a picture or even to pull out the hand-held laser scanner that i happen to own that fits inside a cereal box and could maybe without even touching their bird i swear get a perfect 3d scan and i 'm even willing to sign pages saying that i 'll never let anyone else have it except for me in my office i promise
i 'll give them one if they want it
and then maybe then i 'll achieve the end of this exercise
but really if we 're all going to be honest with ourselves i have to admit that achieving the end of the exercise was never the point of the exercise to begin with was it
thank you
i 'm a process engineer
i know all about boilers and incinerators and fabric filters and cyclones and things like that but i also have marfan syndrome
this is an inherited disorder
and in 1992 i participated in a genetic study and found to my horror as you can see from the slide that my ascending aorta was not in the normal range the green line at the bottom
everyone in here will be between 3.2 and 3.6 cm
i was already up at 4.4
and as you can see my aorta dilated progressively and i got closer and closer to the point where surgery was going to be necessary
the surgery on offer was pretty gruesome anesthetize you open your chest put you on an artificial heart and lung machine drop your body temperature to about 18 centigrade stop your heart cut the aorta out replace it with a plastic valve and a plastic aorta and most importantly commit you to a lifetime of anticoagulation therapy normally warfarin
the thought of the surgery was not attractive
the thought of the warfarin was really quite frightening
so i said to myself i 'm an engineer i 'm in r and d this is just a plumbing problem
i can do this i can change this
so i set out to change the entire treatment for aortic dilation
the project aim is really quite simple
the only real problem with the ascending aorta in people with marfan syndrome is it lacks some tensile strength
so the possibility exists to simply externally wrap the pipe
and it would remain stable and operate quite happily
if your high-pressure hose pipe or your high-pressure hydraulic line bulges a little you just wrap some tape around the outside of it
it really is that simple in concept though not in execution
the great advantage of an external support for me was that i could retain all of my own bits all of my own endothelium and valves and not need any anticoagulation therapy
so where do we start
well this is a sagittal slice through me
you could see in the middle that device that little structure squeezing out
now that 's a left ventricle pushing blood up through the aortic valve you can see two of the leaflets of the aortic valve working there up into the ascending aorta
and it 's that part the ascending aorta which dilates and ultimately bursts which of course is fatal
we started by organizing image acquisition from magnetic resonance imaging machines and ct imaging machines from which to make a model of the patient 's aorta
this is a model of my aorta
i 've got a real one in my pocket if anyone would like to look at it and play with it
you can see it 's quite a complex structure
it has a funny trilobal shape at the bottom which contains the aortic valve
it then comes back into a round form and then tapers and curves off
so it 's quite a difficult structure to produce
this like i say is a cad model of me and this is one of the later cad models
we went through an iterative process of producing better and better models
when we produced that model we turn it into a solid plastic model as you can see using a rapid prototyping technique another engineering technique
we then use that former to manufacture a perfectly bespoke porous textile mesh which takes the shape of the former and perfectly fits the aorta
so this is absolutely personalized medicine at its best really
every patient we do has an absolutely bespoke implant
once you 've made it the installation 's quite easy
john pepper bless his heart professor of cardiothoracic surgery never done it before in his life he put the first one in didn 't like it took it out put the second one in
happy away i went
four and a half hours on the table and everything was done
so the surgical implantation actually was the easiest part
if you compare our new treatment to the existing alternative the so-called composite aortic root graft there are one of two startling comparisons which i 'm sure will be clear to all of you
two hours to install one of our devices compared to six hours for the existing treatment
the existing treatment requires as i 've said the heart and lung bypass machine and it requires a total body cooling
we don 't need any of that we work on a beating heart
he opens you up he accesses the aorta while your heart is beating all at the right temperature
no breaking into your circulatory system
so it really is great
but for me absolutely the best point is there is no anticoagulation therapy required
i don 't take any drugs at all other than recreational ones that i would choose to take
and in fact if you speak to people who are on long-term warfarin it is a serious compromise to your quality of life
and even worse it inevitably foreshortens your life
likewise if you have the artificial valve option you 're committed to antibiotic therapy whenever you have any intrusive medical treatment at all
even trips to the dentist require that you take antibiotics in case you get an internal infection on the valve
again i don 't have any of that so i 'm entirely free
my aorta is fixed i haven 't got to worry about it which is a rebirth for me
back to the theme of the presentation in multidisciplinary research how on earth does a process engineer used to working with boilers end up producing a medical device which transforms his own life
well the answer to that is a multidisciplinary team
this is a list of the core team
and as you can see there are not only two principal technical disciplines there medicine and engineering but also there are various specialists from within those two disciplines
john pepper there was the cardiac surgeon who did the actual work on me but everyone else there had to contribute one way or another
raad mohiaddin medical radiologist we had to get good quality images from which to make the cad model
warren thornton who still does all our cad models for us had to write a bespoke piece of cad code to produce this model from this really rather difficult input data set
there are some barriers to this though there are some problems with it
jargon is a big one
i would think no one in this room understands those four first jargon points there
the engineers amongst you will recognize rapid prototyping and cad
the medics amongst you if there are any will recognize the first two
but there will be nobody else in this room that understands all of those four words
taking the jargon out was very important to ensure that everyone in the team understood exactly what was meant when a particular phrase was used
our disciplinary conventions were funny as well
we took a lot of horizontal slice images through me produced those slices and then used those to build a cad model
and the very first cad model we made the surgeons were playing with the plastic model couldn 't quite figure it out
and then we realized that it was actually a mirror image of the real aorta
and it was a mirror image because in the real world we always look down on plans plans of houses or streets or maps
in the medical world they look up at plans
so the horizontal images were all an inversion
so one needs to be careful with disciplinary conventions
everyone needs to understand what is assumed and what is not assumed
institutional barriers were another serious headache in the project
the brompton hospital was taken over by imperial college 's school of medicine and there are some seriously bad relationship problems between the two organizations
i was working with imperial and the brompton and this generated some serious problems with the project really problems that shouldn 't exist
research and ethics committee if you want to do anything new in surgery you have to get a license from your local research and ethics
i 'm sure it 's the same in poland
there will be some form of equivalent which licenses new types of surgery
we didn 't only have the bureaucratic problems associated with that was also had professional jealousies
there were people on the research and ethics committee who really didn 't want to see john pepper succeed again because he 's so successful
and they made extra problems for us
bureaucratic problems ultimately when you have a new treatment you have to have a guidance note going out for all of the hospitals in the country
in the u.k. we have the national institute for clinical excellence nice
you 'll have an equivalent in poland no doubt
we had to get past the nice problem
we now have a great clinical guidance out on the net
so any of the hospitals interested can come along read the nice report get in touch with us and then get doing it themselves
funding barriers another big area to be concerned with
a big problem with understanding one of those perspectives when we first approached one of the big u.k. charitable organizations that funds this kind of stuff what they were looking at was essentially an engineering proposal
they didn 't understand it they were doctors they were next to god
it must be rubbish they binned it
so in the end i went to private investors and i just gave up on it
but most r and d is going to be institutionally funded by the polish academy of sciences or the engineering and physical sciences research council or whatever and you need to get past those people
jargon is a huge problem when you 're trying to work across disciplines because in an engineering world we all understand cad and r.p. not in the medical world
i suppose ultimately the funding bureaucrats have really got to get their act together
they 've really got to start talking to each other and they 've got to exercise a bit of imagination if that 's not too much to ask which it probably is
i 've coined a phrase obstructive conservatism
so many people in the medical world don 't want to change particularly not when some jumped-up engineer has come along with the answer
they don 't want to change
they simply want to do whatever they 've done before
and in fact there are many surgeons in the u.k.
still waiting for one of our patients to have some sort of episode so that they can say ah i told you that was no good
we 've actually got 30 patients
i 'm at seven and a half years
we 've got 90 post-op patient years between us and we haven 't had a single problem
and still there are people in the u.k. saying yeah that external aortic root yeah it 'll never work you know
it really is a problem it really is a problem
i 'm sure everyone in this room has come across arrogance amongst medics doctors surgeons at some point
the middle point is simply the way that the doctors protect themselves
yeah well of course i 'm looking after my patient
i think it 's not good but there you are that 's my view
egos of course again a huge problem if you 're working in a multidisciplinary team you 've got to give your guys the benefit of the doubt
you 've got to express support for them
tom treasure professor of cardiothoracic surgery incredible guy
dead easy to give him respect
him giving me respect slightly different
that 's all the bad news
the good news is the benefits are stonkingly huge
translate that one i bet they can 't
when you have a group of people who have had a different professional training a different professional experience they not only have a different knowledge base but they have a different perspective on everything
and if you can bring those guys together and you can get them talking and understanding each other the results can be spectacular
you can find novel solutions really novel solutions that have never been looked at before very very quickly and easily
you can shortcut huge amounts of work simply by using the extended knowledge base you have
and as a result it 's an entirely different use of the technology and the knowledge around you
the result of all this is that you can get incredibly quick progress on incredibly small budgets
i 'm so embarrassed at how cheap it was to get from my idea to me being implanted that i 'm not prepared to tell you what it cost
because i suspect there are absolutely standard surgical treatments probably in the usa which cost more for a one-off patient than the cost of us getting from my dream to my reality
that 's all i want to say and i 've got three minutes left
so heather 's going to like me
if you have any questions please come up and talk to me later on
it would be a pleasure to speak with you many thanks
i live and work from tokyo japan
and i specialize in human behavioral research and applying what we learn to think about the future in different ways and to design for that future
and you know to be honest i 've been doing this for seven years and i haven 't got a clue what the future is going to be like
but i 've got a pretty good idea how people will behave when they get there
this is my office it 's out there
it 's not in the lab and it 's increasingly in places like india china brazil africa
we live on a planet 6.3 billion people
about three billion people by the end of this year will have cellular connectivity
and it 'll take about another two years to connect the next billion after that
and i mention this because if we want to design for that future we need to figure out what those people are about
and that 's kind of where i see what my job is and what our team 's job is
our research often starts with a very simple question
so i 'll give you an example what do you carry
if you think of everything in your life that you own when you walk out that door what do you consider to take with you
when you 're looking around what do you consider
of that stuff what do you carry
and of that stuff what do you actually use
so this is interesting to us because the conscious and subconscious decision process implies that the stuff that you do take with you and end up using has some kind of spiritual emotional or functional value
and to put it really bluntly you know people are willing to pay for stuff that has value right
so i 've probably done about five years research looking at what people carry
i go in people 's bags i look in people 's pockets purses
i go in their homes and we do this worldwide and we follow them around town with video cameras
it 's kind of like stalking with permission
and we do all this and to go back to the original question what do people carry
and it turns out that people carry a lot of stuff
ok that 's fair enough
but if you ask people what the three most important things that they carry are across cultures and across gender and across contexts most people will say keys money and if they own one a mobile phone
and i 'm not saying this is a good thing but this is a thing right
i mean i couldn 't take your phones off you if i wanted to
you 'd probably kick me out or something
ok it might seem like an obvious thing for someone who works for a mobile phone company to ask
but really the question is why right
so why are these things so important in our lives
and it turns out from our research that it boils down to survival survival for us and survival for our loved ones
so keys provide an access to shelter and warmth transport as well in the u.s. increasingly
money is useful for buying food sustenance among all its other uses
and a mobile phone it turns out is a great recovery tool
if you prefer this kind of maslow 's hierarchy of needs those three objects are very good at supporting the lowest rungs in maslow 's hierarchy of needs
yes they do a whole bunch of other stuff but they 're very good at this
and in particular it 's the mobile phone 's ability to allow people to transcend space and time
and what i mean by that is you know you can transcend space by simply making a voice call right
and you can transcend time by sending a message at your convenience and someone else can pick it up at their convenience
and this is fairly universally appreciated it turns out which is why we have three billion plus people who have been connected
and they value that connectivity
but actually you can do this kind of stuff with pcs
and you can do them with phone kiosks
and the mobile phone in addition is both personal and so it also gives you a degree of privacy and it 's convenient
you don 't need to ask permission from anyone you can just go ahead and do it right
however for these things to help us survive it depends on them being carried
but and it 's a pretty big but we forget
we 're human that 's what we do it 's one of our features
i think quite a nice feature
so we forget but we 're also adaptable and we adapt to situations around us pretty well
and so we have these strategies to remember and one of them was mentioned yesterday
and it 's quite simply the point of reflection
and that 's that moment when you 're walking out of a space and you turn around and quite often you tap your pockets
even women who keep stuff in their bags tap their pockets
and you turn around and you look back into the space and some people talk aloud
and pretty much everyone does it at some point
ok the next thing is most of you if you have a stable home life and what i mean is that you don 't travel all the time and always in hotels but most people have what we call a center of gravity
and a center of gravity is where you keep these objects
and these things don 't stay in the center of gravity but over time they gravitate there
it 's where you expect to find stuff
and in fact when you 're turning around and you 're looking inside the house and you 're looking for this stuff this is where you look first right
ok so when we did this research we found the absolutely 100 percent guaranteed way to never forget anything ever ever again
and that is quite simply to have nothing to remember
ok now that sounds like something you get on a chinese fortune cookie right
but is in fact about the art of delegation
and from a design perspective it 's about understanding what you can delegate to technology and what you can delegate to other people
and it turns out delegation if you want it to be can be the solution for pretty much everything apart from things like bodily functions going to the toilet
you can 't ask someone to do that on your behalf
and apart from things like entertainment you wouldn 't pay for someone to go to the cinema for you and have fun on your behalf or at least not yet
maybe sometime in the future we will
so let me give you an example of delegation in practice right
so this is probably the thing i 'm most passionate about is the research that we 've been doing on illiteracy and how people who are illiterate communicate
so the u.n. estimated this is 2004 figures that there are almost 800 million people who can 't read and write worldwide
so we 've been conducting a lot of research
and one of the things we were looking at is if you can 't read and write if you want to communicate over distances you need to be able to identify the person that you want to communicate with
it could be a phone number it could be an e-mail address it could be a postal address
simple question if you can 't read and write how do you manage your contact information
and the fact is that millions of people do it
just from a design perspective we didn 't really understand how they did it and so that 's just one small example of the kind of research that we were doing
and it turns out that illiterate people are masters of delegation
so they delegate that part of the task process to other people the stuff that they can 't do themselves
let me give you another example of delegation
this one 's a little bit more sophisticated and this is from a study that we did in uganda about how people who are sharing devices use those devices
sente is a word in uganda that means money
it has a second meaning which is to send money as airtime ok
and it works like this
so let 's say june you 're in a village rural village
i 'm in kampala and i 'm the wage earner
i 'm sending money back and it works like this
so in your village there 's one person in the village with a phone and that 's the phone kiosk operator
and it 's quite likely that they 'd have a quite simple mobile phone as a phone kiosk
so what i do is i buy a prepaid card like this
and instead of using that money to top up my own phone i call up the local village operator
and i read out that number to them and they use it to top up their phone
so they 're topping up the value from kampala and it 's now being topped up in the village
you take a 10 or 20 percent commission and then you the kiosk operator takes 10 or 20 percent commission and passes the rest over to you in cash
ok there 's two things i like about this
so the first is it turns anyone who has access to a mobile phone anyone who has a mobile phone essentially into an atm machine
it brings rudimentary banking services to places where there 's no banking infrastructure
and even if they could have access to the banking infrastructure they wouldn 't necessarily be considered viable customers because they 're not wealthy enough to have bank accounts
there 's a second thing i like about this
and that is that despite all the resources at my disposal and despite all our kind of apparent sophistication i know i could never have designed something as elegant and as totally in tune with the local conditions as this ok
and yes there are things like grameen bank and micro-lending
but the difference between this and that is there 's no central authority trying to control this
this is just street-up innovation
so it turns out the street is a never-ending source of inspiration for us
and ok if you break one of these things here you return it to the carrier
they 'll give you a new one
they 'll probably give you three new ones right
i mean that 's buy three get one free that kind of thing
if you go on the streets of india and china you see this kind of stuff
and this is where they take the stuff that breaks and they fix it and they put it back into circulation
this is from a workbench in jilin city in china and you can see people taking down a phone and putting it back together
they reverse-engineer manuals
this is a kind of hacker 's manual and it 's written in chinese and english
they also write them in hindi
you can subscribe to these
there are training institutes where they 're churning out people for fixing these things as well
but what i like about this is it boils down to someone on the street with a small flat surface a screwdriver a toothbrush for cleaning the contact heads because they often get dust on the contact heads and knowledge
and it 's all about the social network of the knowledge floating around
and i like this because it challenges the way that we design stuff and build stuff and potentially distribute stuff
it challenges the norms
ok for me the street just raises so many different questions
like this is viagra that i bought from a backstreet sex shop in china
and china is a country where you get a lot of fakes
and i know what you 're asking did i test it
i 'm not going to answer that ok
but i look at something like this and i consider the implications of trust and confidence in the purchase process
and we look at this and we think well how does that apply for example for the design of the lessons from this apply to the design of online services future services in these markets
this is a pair of underpants from from tibet
and i look at something like this and honestly you know why would someone design underpants with a pocket right
and i look at something like this and it makes me question if we were to take all the functionality in things like this and redistribute them around the body in some kind of personal area network how would we prioritize where to put stuff
and yes this is quite trivial but actually the lessons from this can apply to that kind of personal area networks
and what you see here is a couple of phone numbers written above the shack in rural uganda
this doesn 't have house numbers this has phone numbers
so what does it mean when people 's identity is mobile
when those extra three billion people 's identity is mobile it isn 't fixed
your notion of identity is out-of-date already ok for those extra three billion people
this is how it 's shifting
and then i go to this picture here which is the one that i started with
and this is from delhi
it 's from a study we did into illiteracy and it 's a guy in a teashop
you can see the chai being poured in the background
and he 's a you know incredibly poor teashop worker on the lowest rungs in the society
and he somehow has the appreciation of the values of livestrong
and it 's not necessarily the same values but some kind of values of livestrong to actually go out and purchase them and actually display them
for me this kind of personifies this connected world where everything is intertwined and the dots are it 's all about the dots joining together
ok the title of this presentation is connections and consequences and it 's really a kind of summary of five years of trying to figure out what it 's going to be like when everyone on the planet has the ability to transcend space and time in a personal and convenient manner right
when everyone 's connected
and there are four things
so the first thing is the immediacy of ideas the speed at which ideas go around
and i know ted is about big ideas but actually the benchmark for a big idea is changing
if you want a big idea you need to embrace everyone on the planet that 's the first thing
the second thing is the immediacy of objects
and what i mean by that is as these become smaller as the functionality that you can access through this becomes greater things like banking identity these things quite simply move very quickly around the world
and so the speed of the adoption of things is just going to become that much more rapid in a way that we just totally cannot conceive when you get it to 6.3 billion and the growth in the world 's population
the next thing is that however we design this stuff carefully design this stuff the street will take it and will figure out ways to innovate as long as it meets base needs the ability to transcend space and time for example
and it will innovate in ways that we cannot anticipate
in ways that despite our resources they can do it better than us
that 's my feeling
and if we 're smart we 'll look at this stuff that 's going on and we 'll figure out a way to enable it to inform and infuse both what we design and how we design
and the last thing is that actually the direction of the conversation
with another three billion people connected they want to be part of the conversation
and i think our relevance and ted 's relevance is really about embracing that and learning how to listen essentially
and we need to learn how to listen
so thank you very very much

i write about food i write about cooking
i take it quite seriously but i 'm here to talk about something that 's become very important to me in the last year or two
it is about food but it 's not about cooking per se
i 'm going to start with this picture of a beautiful cow
i 'm not a vegetarian this is the old nixon line right
but i still think that this may be this year 's version of this
now that is only a little bit hyperbolic
and why do i say it
because only once before has the fate of individual people and the fate of all of humanity been so intertwined
there was the bomb and there 's now
and where we go from here is going to determine not only the quality and the length of our individual lives but whether if we could see the earth a century from now we 'd recognize it
it 's a holocaust of a different kind and hiding under our desks isn 't going to help
start with the notion that global warming is not only real but dangerous
since every scientist in the world now believes this and even president bush has seen the light or pretends to we can take this is a given
then hear this please
after energy production livestock is the second-highest contributor to atmosphere-altering gases
nearly one-fifth of all greenhouse gas is generated by livestock production more than transportation
now you can make all the jokes you want about cow farts but methane is 20 times more poisonous than co2 and it 's not just methane
livestock is also one of the biggest culprits in land degradation air and water pollution water shortages and loss of biodiversity
there 's more
like half the antibiotics in this country are not administered to people but to animals
but lists like this become kind of numbing so let me just say this if you 're a progressive if you 're driving a prius or you 're shopping green or you 're looking for organic you should probably be a semi-vegetarian
now i 'm no more anti-cattle than i am anti-atom but it 's all in the way we use these things
there 's another piece of the puzzle which ann cooper talked about beautifully yesterday and one you already know
there 's no question none that so-called lifestyle diseases diabetes heart disease stroke some cancers are diseases that are far more prevalent here than anywhere in the rest of the world
and that 's the direct result of eating a western diet
our demand for meat dairy and refined carbohydrates the world consumes one billion cans or bottles of coke a day our demand for these things not our need our want drives us to consume way more calories than are good for us
and those calories are in foods that cause not prevent disease
now global warming was unforeseen
we didn 't know that pollution did more than cause bad visibility
maybe a few lung diseases here and there but you know that 's not such a big deal
the current health crisis however is a little more the work of the evil empire
we were told we were assured that the more meat and dairy and poultry we ate the healthier we 'd be
no overconsumption of animals and of course junk food is the problem along with our paltry consumption of plants
now there 's no time to get into the benefits of eating plants here but the evidence is that plants and i want to make this clear it 's not the ingredients in plants it 's the plants
it 's not the beta-carotene it 's the carrot
the evidence is very clear that plants promote health
this evidence is overwhelming at this point
you eat more plants you eat less other stuff you live longer
not bad
but back to animals and junk food
what do they have in common
one we don 't need either of them for health
we don 't need animal products and we certainly don 't need white bread or coke
two both have been marketed heavily creating unnatural demand
we 're not born craving whoppers or skittles
three their production has been supported by government agencies at the expense of a more health- and earth-friendly diet
now let 's imagine a parallel
let 's pretend that our government supported an oil-based economy while discouraging more sustainable forms of energy knowing all the while that the result would be pollution war and rising costs
incredible isn 't it
yet they do that
and they do this here it 's the same deal
the sad thing is when it comes to diet is that even when well-intentioned feds try to do right by us they fail
either they 're outvoted by puppets of agribusiness or they are puppets of agribusiness
so when the usda finally acknowledged that it was plants rather than animals that made people healthy they encouraged us via their overly simplistic food pyramid to eat five servings of fruits and vegetables a day along with more carbs
what they didn 't tell us is that some carbs are better than others and that plants and whole grains should be supplanting eating junk food
but industry lobbyists would never let that happen
and guess what
half the people who developed the food pyramid have ties to agribusiness
so instead of substituting plants for animals our swollen appetites simply became larger and the most dangerous aspects of them remained unchanged
so-called low-fat diets so-called low-carb diets these are not solutions
but with lots of intelligent people focusing on whether food is organic or local or whether we 're being nice to animals the most important issues just aren 't being addressed
now don 't get me wrong
i like animals and i don 't think it 's just fine to industrialize their production and to churn them out like they were wrenches
but there 's no way to treat animals well when you 're killing 10 billion of them a year
that 's our number 10 billion
if you strung all of them chickens cows pigs and lambs to the moon they 'd go there and back five times there and back
now my math 's a little shaky but this is pretty good and it depends whether a pig is four feet long or five feet long but you get the idea
that 's just the united states
and with our hyper-consumption of those animals producing greenhouse gases and heart disease kindness might just be a bit of a red herring
let 's get the numbers of the animals we 're killing for eating down and then we 'll worry about being nice to the ones that are left
another red herring might be exemplified by the word locavore which was just named word of the year by the new oxford american dictionary
seriously
and locavore for those of you who don 't know is someone who eats only locally grown food which is fine if you live in california but for the rest of us it 's a bit of a sad joke
between the official story the food pyramid and the hip locavore vision you have two versions of how to improve our eating
they both get it wrong though
the first at least is populist and the second is elitist
how we got to this place is the history of food in the united states
and i 'm going to go through that at least the last hundred years or so very quickly right now
a hundred years ago guess what
everyone was a locavore even new york had pig farms nearby and shipping food all over the place was a ridiculous notion
every family had a cook usually a mom
and those moms bought and prepared food
it was like your romantic vision of europe
margarine didn 't exist
in fact when margarine was invented several states passed laws declaring that it had to be dyed pink so we 'd all know that it was a fake
there was no snack food and until the 20s until clarence birdseye came along there was no frozen food
there were no restaurant chains
there were neighborhood restaurants run by local people but none of them would think to open another one
eating ethnic was unheard of unless you were ethnic
and fancy food was entirely french
as an aside those of you who remember dan aykroyd in the 1970s doing julia child imitations can see where he got the idea of stabbing himself from this fabulous slide
back in those days before even julia back in those days there was no philosophy of food
you just ate
you didn 't claim to be anything
there was no marketing there were no national brands
vitamins had not been invented
there were no health claims at least not federally sanctioned ones
fats carbs proteins they weren 't bad or good they were food
you ate food
hardly anything contained more than one ingredient because it was an ingredient
the cornflake hadn 't been invented
the pop-tart the pringle cheez whiz none of that stuff
goldfish swam
it 's hard to imagine people grew food and they ate food
and again everyone ate local
in new york an orange was a common christmas present because it came all the way from florida
from the 30s on road systems expanded trucks took the place of railroads fresh food began to travel more
oranges became common in new york
the south and west became agricultural hubs and in other parts of the country suburbs took over farmland
the effects of this are well known they are everywhere
and the death of family farms is part of this puzzle as is almost everything from the demise of the real community to the challenge of finding a good tomato even in summer
eventually california produced too much food to ship fresh so it became critical to market canned and frozen foods
thus arrived convenience
it was sold to proto-feminist housewives as a way to cut down on housework
now i know everybody over the age of like 45 their mouths are watering at this point
if we had a slide of salisbury steak even more so right
but this may have cut down on housework but it cut down on the variety of food we ate as well
many of us grew up never eating a fresh vegetable except the occasional raw carrot or maybe an odd lettuce salad
i for one and i 'm not kidding didn 't eat real spinach or broccoli till i was 19
who needed it though meat was everywhere
what could be easier more filling or healthier for your family than broiling a steak
but by then cattle were already raised unnaturally
rather than spending their lives eating grass for which their stomachs were designed they were forced to eat soy and corn
they have trouble digesting those grains of course but that wasn 't a problem for producers
new drugs kept them healthy
well they kept them alive
healthy was another story
thanks to farm subsidies the fine collaboration between agribusiness and congress soy corn and cattle became king
and chicken soon joined them on the throne
it was during this period that the cycle of dietary and planetary destruction began the thing we 're only realizing just now
listen to this between 1950 and 2000 the world 's population doubled
meat consumption increased five-fold
now someone had to eat all that stuff so we got fast food
and this took care of the situation resoundingly
home cooking remained the norm but its quality was down the tubes
there were fewer meals with home-cooked breads desserts and soups because all of them could be bought at any store
not that they were any good but they were there
most moms cooked like mine a piece of broiled meat a quickly made salad with bottled dressing canned soup canned fruit salad
maybe baked or mashed potatoes or perhaps the stupidest food ever minute rice
for dessert store-bought ice cream or cookies
my mom is not here so i can say this now
this kind of cooking drove me to learn how to cook for myself
it wasn 't all bad
by the 70s forward-thinking people began to recognize the value of local ingredients
we tended gardens we became interested in organic food we knew or we were vegetarians
we weren 't all hippies either
some of us were eating in good restaurants and learning how to cook well
meanwhile food production had become industrial industrial
perhaps because it was being produced rationally as if it were plastic food gained magical or poisonous powers or both
many people became fat-phobic
others worshiped broccoli as if it were god-like
but mostly they didn 't eat broccoli
instead they were sold on yogurt yogurt being almost as good as broccoli
except in reality the way the industry sold yogurt was to convert it to something much more akin to ice cream
similarly let 's look at a granola bar
you think that that might be healthy food but in fact if you look at the ingredient list it 's closer in form to a snickers than it is to oatmeal
sadly it was at this time that the family dinner was put in a coma if not actually killed the beginning of the heyday of value-added food which contained as many soy and corn products as could be crammed into it
think of the frozen chicken nugget
the chicken is fed corn and then its meat is ground up and mixed with more corn products to add bulk and binder and then it 's fried in corn oil
all you do is nuke it what could be better
and zapped horribly pathetically
by the 70s home cooking was in such a sad state that the high fat and spice contents of foods like mcnuggets and hot pockets and we all have our favorites actually made this stuff more appealing than the bland things that people were serving at home
at the same time masses of women were entering the workforce and cooking simply wasn 't important enough for men to share the burden
so now you 've got your pizza nights you 've got your microwave nights you 've got your grazing nights you 've got your fend-for-yourself nights and so on
leading the way what 's leading the way
meat junk food cheese the very stuff that will kill you
so now we clamor for organic food
that 's good
and as evidence that things can actually change you can now find organic food in supermarkets and even in fast-food outlets
but organic food isn 't the answer either at least not the way it 's currently defined
let me pose you a question
can farm-raised salmon be organic when its feed has nothing to do with its natural diet even if the feed itself is supposedly organic and the fish themselves are packed tightly in pens swimming in their own filth
and if that salmon 's from chile and it 's killed down there and then flown 5,000 miles whatever dumping how much carbon into the atmosphere
i don 't know
packed in styrofoam of course before landing somewhere in the united states and then being trucked a few hundred more miles
this may be organic in letter but it 's surely not organic in spirit
now here is where we all meet
the locavores the organivores the vegetarians the vegans the gourmets and those of us who are just plain interested in good food
even though we 've come to this from different points we all have to act on our knowledge to change the way that everyone thinks about food
we need to start acting
and this is not only an issue of social justice as ann cooper said and of course she 's completely right but it 's also one of global survival
which bring me full circle and points directly to the core issue the overproduction and overconsumption of meat and junk food
as i said 18 percent of greenhouse gases are attributed to livestock production
how much livestock do you need to produce this
70 percent of the agricultural land on earth 30 percent of the earth 's land surface is directly or indirectly devoted to raising the animals we 'll eat
and this amount is predicted to double in the next 40 years or so
and if the numbers coming in from china are anything like what they look like now it 's not going to be 40 years
there is no good reason for eating as much meat as we do
and i say this as a man who has eaten a fair share of corned beef in his life
the most common argument is that we need nutrients even though we eat on average twice as much protein as even the industry-obsessed usda recommends
but listen experts who are serious about disease reduction recommend that adults eat just over half a pound of meat per week
what do you think we eat per day half a pound
but don 't we need meat to be big and strong
isn 't meat eating essential to health
won 't a diet heavy in fruit and vegetables turn us into godless sissy liberals
some of us might think that would be a good thing
but no even if we were all steroid-filled football players the answer is no
in fact there 's no diet on earth that meets basic nutritional needs that won 't promote growth and many will make you much healthier than ours does
we don 't eat animal products for sufficient nutrition we eat them to have an odd form of malnutrition and it 's killing us
to suggest that in the interests of personal and human health americans eat 50 percent less meat it 's not enough of a cut but it 's a start
it would seem absurd but that 's exactly what should happen and what progressive people forward-thinking people should be doing and advocating along with the corresponding increase in the consumption of plants
i 've been writing about food more or less omnivorously one might say indiscriminately for about 30 years
during that time i 've eaten and recommended eating just about everything
i 'll never stop eating animals i 'm sure but i do think that for the benefit of everyone the time has come to stop raising them industrially and stop eating them thoughtlessly
ann cooper 's right
the usda is not our ally here
we have to take matters into our own hands not only by advocating for a better diet for everyone and that 's the hard part but by improving our own
and that happens to be quite easy
less meat less junk more plants
it 's a simple formula eat food
eat real food
we can continue to enjoy our food and we continue to eat well and we can eat even better
we can continue the search for the ingredients we love and we can continue to spin yarns about our favorite meals
we 'll reduce not only calories but our carbon footprint
we can make food more important not less and save ourselves by doing so
we have to choose that path
thank you
i 'm dr. david hanson and i build robots with character
and by that i mean that i develop robots that are characters but also robots that will eventually come to empathize with you
so we 're starting with a variety of technologies that have converged into these conversational character robots that can see faces make eye contact with you make a full range of facial expressions understand speech and begin to model how you 're feeling and who you are and build a relationship with you
i developed a series of technologies that allowed the robots to make more realistic facial expressions than previously achieved on lower power which enabled the walking biped robots the first androids
so it 's a full range of facial expressions simulating all the major muscles in the human face running on very small batteries extremely lightweight
the materials that allowed the battery-operated facial expressions is a material that we call frubber and it actually has three major innovations in the material that allow this to happen
one is hierarchical pores and the other is a macro-molecular nanoscale porosity in the material
there he 's starting to walk
this is at the korean advanced institute of science and technology
i built the head they built the body
so the goal here is to achieve sentience in machines and not just sentience but empathy
we 're working with the machine perception laboratory at the u.c. san diego
they have this really remarkable facial expression technology that recognizes facial expressions what facial expressions you 're making
it also recognizes where you 're looking your head orientation
we 're emulating all the major facial expressions and then controlling it with the software that we call the character engine
and here is a little bit of the technology that 's involved in that
in fact right now plug it from here and then plug it in here and now let 's see if it gets my facial expressions
okay so i 'm smiling
now i 'm frowning
and this is really heavily backlit
okay here we go
oh it 's so sad
okay so you smile frowning
so his perception of your emotional states is very important for machines to effectively become empathetic
machines are becoming devastatingly capable of things like killing right
those machines have no place for empathy
and there is billions of dollars being spent on that
character robotics could plant the seed for robots that actually have empathy
so if they achieve human level intelligence or quite possibly greater than human levels of intelligence this could be the seeds of hope for our future
so we 've made 20 robots in the last eight years during the course of getting my ph.d.
and then i started hanson robotics which has been developing these things for mass manufacturing
this is one of our robots that we showed at wired nextfest a couple of years ago
and it sees multiple people in a scene remembers where individual people are and looks from person to person remembering people
so we 're involving two things
one the perception of people and two the natural interface the natural form of the interface so that it 's more intuitive for you to interact with the robot
you start to believe that it 's alive and aware
so one of my favorite projects was bringing all this stuff together in an artistic display of an android portrait of science-fiction writer philip k. dick who wrote great works like do androids dream of electric sheep
which was the basis of the movie bladerunner
in these stories robots often think that they 're human and they sort of come to life
so we put his writings letters his interviews correspondences into a huge database of thousands of pages and then used some natural language processing to allow you to actually have a conversation with him
and it was kind of spooky because he would say these things that just sounded like they really understood you
and this is one of the most exciting projects that we 're developing which is a little character that 's a spokesbot for friendly artificial intelligence friendly machine intelligence
and we 're getting this mass-manufactured
we specked it out to actually be doable with a very very low-cost bill of materials so that it can become a childhood companion for kids
interfacing with the internet it gets smarter over the years
as artificial intelligence evolves so does his intelligence
thank you so much that 's incredible
for the last 20 years i 've been designing puzzles
and i 'm here today to give you a little tour starting from the very first puzzle i designed through what i 'm doing now
i 've designed puzzles for books printed things
i 'm the puzzle columnist for discover magazine
i 've been doing that for about 10 years
i have a monthly puzzle calendar
i do toys the bulk of my work is in computer games
i did puzzles for bejeweled
i didn 't invent bejeweled i can 't take credit for that
so very first puzzle sixth grade my teacher said oh let 's see that guy he likes to make stuff
i 'll have him cut out letters out of construction paper for the board
i thought this was a great assignment
and so here is what i came up with i start fiddling with it
i came up with this letter this is a letter of the alphabet that 's been folded just once
the question is which letter is it if i unfold it
one hint it 's not l .
it could be an l of course
so what else could it be
yeah a lot of you got it
oh yeah so clever thing
now that was my first puzzle i got hooked
i created something new i was very excited because you know i 'd made crossword puzzles but that 's sort of like filling in somebody else 's matrix
this was something really original i got hooked
i read martin gardner 's columns in scientific american
went on and eventually decided to devote myself full time to that
now i should pause and say what do i mean by puzzle
a puzzle is a problem that is fun to solve and has a right answer
fun to solve as opposed to everyday problems which frankly are not very well-designed puzzles
you know they might have a solution
it might take a long time nobody wrote down the rules clearly
who designed this
it 's like you know life is not a very well-written story so we have to hire writers to make movies
well i take everyday problems and i make puzzles out of them
and right answer of course there might be more than one right answer many puzzles have more than one
but as opposed to a couple other forms of play toys and games by toy i mean something you play with that doesn 't have a particular goal
you can create one out of legos
you know you can do anything you want
or competitive games like chess where well you 're not trying to solve ... you can make a chess puzzle but the goal really is to beat another player
i consider that puzzles are an art form
they 're very ancient it goes back as long as there is written history
it 's a very small form like a joke a poem a magic trick or a song very compact form
at worst they 're throwaways they 're for amusement
but at best they can reach for something more and create a memorable impression
the progression of my career that you 'll see is looking for creating puzzles that have a memorable impact
so one thing i found early on when i started doing computer games is that i could create puzzles that will alter your perception
i 'll show you how here is a famous one
so it 's two profiles in black or a white vase in the middle
this is called a figure-ground illusion
the artist m.c. escher exploited that in some of his wonderful prints
here we have day and night
here is what i did with figure and ground
so here we have figure in black
here we have figure in white
and it 's all part of the same design
the background to one is the other
originally i tried to do the words figure and ground
but i couldn 't do that i realized i changed the problem
it 's all figure
a few other things here is my name
and that turns into the title of my first book inversions
these sorts of designs now go by the word ambigram
i 'll show you just a couple others here we have the numbers one through 10 the digits zero through nine actually
each letter here is one of these digits
not strictly an ambigram in the conventional sense
i like pushing on what an ambigram can mean
here 's the word mirror no it 's not the same upside-down
it 's the same this way
and a marvelous fellow from the media lab who just got appointed head of risd is john maeda
and so i did this for him it 's sort of a visual canon
and recently in magic magazine i 've done a number of ambigrams on magician 's names
so here we have penn and teller same upside-down
this appears in my puzzle calendar
okay let 's go back to the slides
thank you very much
now those are fun to look at
now how would you do it interactively
for a while i was an interface designer
and so i think a lot about interaction
well let 's first of all simplify the vases illusion make the thing on the right
now if you could pick up the black vase it would look like the figure on top
if you could pick up the white area it would look like the figure on the bottom
well you can 't do that physically but on a computer you can do it let 's switch over to the p.c.
and here it is figure-ground
the goal here is to take the pieces on the left and make them so they look like the shape on the right
and this follows the rules i just said any black area that is surrounded by white can be picked up
but that is also true of any white area
so here we got the white area in the middle and you can pick it up
i 'll just go one step further
so here is here is a couple pieces move them together and now this is an active piece
you can really get inside somebody 's perception and have them experience something
it 's like the old maxim of you can tell somebody something and show them but if they do it they really learn it
here is another thing you can do
there is a game called rush hour
this is one of the true masterpieces in puzzle design besides rubik 's cube
so here we have a crowded parking lot with cars all over the place
the goal is to get the red car out it 's a sliding block puzzle
it 's made by the company think fun
it 's done very well i love this puzzle
well let 's play one here so here is a very simple puzzle
well that 's too simple let 's add another piece
okay so how would you solve this one
well move the blue one out of the way
here let 's make it a little harder still pretty easy
now we 'll make it harder a little harder
now this one is a little bit trickier
you know what do you do here
the first move is going to be what
you 're going to move the blue one up in order to get the lavender one to the right
and you can make puzzles like this one that aren 't solvable at all
those four are locked in a pinwheel you can 't get them apart
i wanted to make a sequel
i didn 't come up with the original idea but this is another way i work as an inventor is to create a sequel
i came up with this this is railroad rush hour
it 's the same basic game except i introduced a new piece a square piece that can move both horizontally and vertically
in the other game the cars can only move forward and back
created a whole bunch of levels for it
now i 'm making it available to schools
and it includes exercises that show you not just how to solve these puzzles but how to extract the principles that will let you solve mathematical puzzles or problems in science other areas
so i 'm really interested in you learning how to make your own puzzles as well as just me creating them
garry trudeau calls himself an investigative cartoonist
you know he does a lot of research before he writes a cartoon
in discover magazine i 'm an investigative puzzle maker
i got interested in gene sequencing
and i said well how on earth can you come up with a sequence of the base pairs in dna
cut up the dna you sequence individual pieces and then you look for overlaps and you basically match them at the edges and i said this is kind of like a jigsaw puzzle except the pieces overlap
so here is what i created for discover magazine
and it has to be solvable in a magazine
you know you can 't cut out the pieces and move them around
so here is the nine pieces and you 're supposed to put them into this grid
and you have to choose pieces that overlap on the edge
there is only one solution it 's not that hard
but it takes some persistence
and when you 're done it makes this design which if you squint is the word helix
so that 's the form of the puzzle coming out of the content rather than the other way around
here is a couple more here is a physics-based puzzle
which way will these fall
one of these weighs 50 pounds 30 pounds and 10 pounds
and depending on which one weighs which amount they 'll fall different directions
and here is a puzzle based on color mixing
i separated this image into cyan magenta yellow black the basic printing colors and then mixed up the separations and you get these peculiar pictures
which separations were mixed up to make those pictures
gets you thinking about color
finally what i 'm doing now so shufflebrain.com website you can go visit i joined up with my wife amy-jo kim
she could easily be up here giving a talk about her work
so we 're making smart games for social media
i 'll explain what that means we 're looking at three trends
this is what 's going on in the games industry right now
first of all you know for a long time computer games meant things like doom where you 're going around shooting things very violent games very fast aimed at teenage boys right that 's who plays computer games
well guess what that 's changing
bejeweled is a big hit it was the game that really broke open what 's called casual games
and the main players are over 35 and are female
then recently rock band has been a big hit
and it 's a game you play with other people
it 's very physical it looks nothing like a traditional game
this is what 's becoming the dominant form of electronic gaming
now within that there is some interesting things happening
there is also a trend towards games that are good for you
why well we aging boomers baby boomers we 're eating our healthy food we 're exercising what about our minds
oh no our parents are getting alzheimer 's we better do something
turns out doing crossword puzzles can stave off some of the effects of alzheimer 's
so we got games like brain age coming out for the nintendo ds huge hit
a lot of people do sudoku in fact some doctors prescribe it
and then there is social media and what 's happening on the internet
everybody now considers themselves a creator and not just a viewer
and what does this add up to
here is what we see coming
it 's games that fit into a healthy lifestyle
they 're part of your life they 're not necessarily a separate thing
and they are both something that is good for you and they 're fun
i 'm a puzzle guy my wife is an expert in social media
and we decided to combine our skills
our first game is called photo grab the game takes about a minute and 20 seconds
this is your first time playing my game okay
let 's see how well we can do there are three images
and we have 24 seconds each
where is that
i 'll play as fast as i can
but if you can see it shout out the answer
you get more down okay yeah where is that
oh yeah there okay j-o and i guess that 's that part we got the bow that bow helps
that 's his hair you get a lot of figure-ground problems
yeah that one is easy okay so ahhh okay on to the next one
okay so that 's the lens
anybody
looks like a black shape so where is that
that 's the corner of the whole thing
yeah i 've played this image before but even when i make up my own puzzles and you can put your own images in here
and we have people all over the world doing that now
there we are visit shufflebrain.com if you want to try it yourself thank you
this is the exact moment that i started creating something called tinkering school
tinkering school is a place where kids can pick up sticks and hammers and other dangerous objects and be trusted
trusted not to hurt themselves and trusted not to hurt others
tinkering school doesn 't follow a set curriculum and there are no tests
we 're not trying to teach anybody any specific thing
when the kids arrive they 're confronted with lots of stuff wood and nails and rope and wheels and lots of tools real tools
it 's a six-day immersive experience for the kids
and within that context we can offer the kids time something that seems in short supply in their over-scheduled lives
our goal is to ensure that they leave with a better sense of how to make things than when they arrived and the deep internal realization that you can figure things out by fooling around
nothing ever turns out as planned ... ever
and the kids soon learn that all projects go awry and become at ease with the idea that every step in a project is a step closer to sweet success or gleeful calamity
we start from doodles and sketches
and sometimes we make real plans
and sometimes we just start building
building is at the heart of the experience hands on deeply immersed and fully committed to the problem at hand
robin and i acting as collaborators keep the landscape of the projects tilted towards completion
success is in the doing and failures are celebrated and analyzed
problems become puzzles and obstacles disappear
when faced with particularly difficult setbacks or complexities a really interesting behavior emerges decoration
decoration of the unfinished project is a kind of conceptual incubation
from these interludes come deep insights and amazing new approaches to solving the problems that had them frustrated just moments before
all materials are available for use
even those mundane hateful plastic grocery bags can become a bridge stronger than anyone imagined
and the things that they build amaze even themselves
three two one go
gever tulley a rollercoaster built by seven-year-olds
yay
gt thank you it 's been a great pleasure

i don 't know what the hell i 'm doing here
i was born in a scots presbyterian ghetto in canada and dropped out of high school i don 't own a cell phone and i paint on paper using gouache which hasn 't changed in 600 years
but about three years ago i had an art show in new york and i titled it serious nonsense
so i think i 'm actually the first one here i lead
i called it serious nonsense because on the serious side i use a technique of painstaking realism of editorial illustration from when i was a kid i copied it and i never unlearned it it 's the only style i know and it 's very kind of staid and formal
and meanwhile i use nonsense as you can see
this is a scottish castle where people are playing golf indoors and the trick was to bang the golf ball off of suits of armor which you can 't see there
this was one of a series called zany afternoons which became a book
this is a home-built rocket-propelled car that 's a 1953 henry j i 'm a bug for authenticity in a quiet neighborhood in toledo
this is my submission for the l.a. museum of film
you can probably tell frank gehry and i come from the same town
my work is so personal and so strange that i have to invent my own lexicon for it
and i work a lot in what i call retrofuturism which is looking back to see how yesterday viewed tomorrow
and they 're always wrong always hilariously optimistically wrong
and the peak time for that was the 30s because the depression was so dismal that anything to get away from the present into the future ...
and technology was going to carry us along
this is popular workbench popular science magazines in those days i had a huge collection of them from the 30s all they are is just poor people being asked to make sunglasses out of wire coat hangers and everything improvised and dreaming about these wonderful giant radio robots playing ice hockey at 300 miles an hour it 's all going to happen it 's all going to be wonderful
automotive retrofuturism is one of my specialties
i was both an automobile illustrator and an advertising automobile copywriter so i have a lot of revenge to take on the subject
detroit has always been halfway into the future the advertising half
this is the 58 bulgemobile so new they make tomorrow look like yesterday
this is a chain gang of guys admiring the car
that 's from a whole catalog it 's 18 pages or so ran back in the days of the lampoon where i cut my teeth
techno-archaeology is digging back and finding past miracles that never happened for good reason usually
the zeppelin this was from a brochure about the zeppelin based obviously on the hindenburg
but the zeppelin was the biggest thing that ever moved made by man
and it carried 56 people at the speed of a buick at an altitude you could hear dogs bark and it cost twice as much as a first-class cabin on the normandie to fly it
so the hindenburg wasn 't you know it was inevitable it was going to go
this is auto-gyro jousting in malibu in the 30s
the auto-gyro couldn 't wait for the invention of the helicopter but it should have it wasn 't a big success
it 's the only spanish innovation technologically of the 20th century by the way
you needed to know that
the flying car which never got off the ground it was a post-war dream
my old man used to tell me we were going to get a flying car
this is pitched into the future from 1946 looking at the day all american families have them
there 's moscow shirley hope they speak esperanto
faux-nostalgia which i 'm sort of not say famous for but i work an awful lot in it
it 's the achingly sentimental yearning for times that never happened
somebody once said that nostalgia is the one utterly most useless human emotion so i think that 's a case for serious play
this is emblematic of it this is wing dining recalling those balmy summer days somewhere over france in the 20s dining on the wing of a plane you can 't see it very well here but that 's hemingway reading some pages from his new novel to fitzgerald and ford madox ford until the slipstream blows him away
this is tank polo in the south hamptons
the brainless rich are more fun to make fun of than anybody i do a lot of that
and authenticity is a major part of my serious nonsense
i think it adds a huge amount
those for example are mark iv british tanks from 1916
they had two machine guns and a cannon and they had 90 horsepower ricardo engines
they went five miles an hour and inside it was 105 degrees in the pitch dark
and they had a canary hung inside the thing to make sure the germans weren 't going to use gas
happy little story isn 't it
this is motor ritz towers in manhattan in the 30s where you drove up to your front door if you had the guts
anybody who was anybody had an apartment there
i managed to stick in both the zeppelin and an ocean liner out of sheer enthusiasm
and i love cigars there 's a cigar billboard down there
and faux-nostalgia works even in serious subjects like war
this is those wonderful days of the battle of britain in 1940 when a messerschmitt me109 bursts into the house of commons and buzzes around just to piss off churchill who 's down there somewhere
it 's a fond memory of times past
hyperbolic overkill is a way of taking exaggeration to the absolute ultimate limit just for the fun of it this was a piece i did a brochure again rms tyrannic the biggest thing in all the world
the copy which you can 't see because it goes on and on for several pages says that steerage passengers can 't get their to bunks before the voyage is over and it 's so safe it carries no insurance
it 's obviously modeled on the titanic
but it 's not a cri de coeur about man 's hubris in the face of the elements
it 's just a sick silly joke
shamelessly cheap is something i think this will wake you up
it has no meaning just desoto discovers the mississippi and it 's a desoto discovering the mississippi
i did that as a quick back page i had like four hours to do a back page for an issue of the lampoon and i did that and i thought well i 'm ashamed i hope nobody knows it
people wrote in for reprints of that thing
urban absurdism that 's what the new yorker really calls for
i try to make life in new york look even weirder than it is with those covers
i 've done about 40 of them and i 'd say 30 of them are based on that concept
i was driving down 7th avenue one night at 3 a.m. and this steam pouring out of the street and i thought what causes that and that who 's to say
the temple of dendur at the metropolitan in new york it 's a very somber place
i thought i could jazz it up a bit have a little fun with it
this is a very un-pc cover not in new york
i couldn 't resist and i got a nasty email from some environmental group saying this is too serious and solemn to make fun of you should be ashamed please apologize on our website
haven 't got around to it yet but i may
this is the word side of my brain
i love the word eurotrash
that 's all the eurotrash coming through jfk customs
this was the new york bike messenger meeting the tour de france
if you live in new york you know how the bike messengers move
except that he 's carrying a tube for blueprints and stuff they all do and a lot of people thought that meant it was a terrorist about to shoot rockets at the tour de france sign of our times i guess
this is the only fashion cover i 've ever done
it 's the little old lady that lives in a shoe and then this thing the title of that was there goes the neighborhood
i don 't know a hell of a lot about fashion i was told to do what they call a mary jane and then i got into this terrible fight between the art director and the editor saying because it obscures the logo and looks terrible and it 's bad and i finally chickened out and did it for the sake of the authenticity of the shoe
this is a tiny joke e-zr pass one letter makes an idea
this is a big joke
this is the audition for king kong
people always ask me where do you get your ideas how do your ideas come
truth about that one is i had a horrible red wine hangover in the middle of the night this came to me like a xerox all i had to do was write it down
it was perfectly clear i didn 't do any thinking about it
and then when it ran a lovely lady an old lady named mrs. edgar rosenberg if you know that name called me and said she loved the cover it was so sweet
her former name was fay wray and so that was i didn 't have the wit to say take the painting
finally this was a three-page cover never done before and i don 't think it will ever be done again successive pages in the front of the magazine
it 's the ascent of man using an escalator and it 's in three parts
you can 't see it all together unfortunately but if you look at it enough you can sort of start to see how it actually starts to move
pretty elegant nothing like a crash to end a joke that completes my oeuvre
i would just like to add a crass commercial i have a kids book coming out in the fall called marvel sandwiches a compendium of all the serious play that ever was and it 's going to be available in fine bookstores crummy bookstores tables on the street in october
so thank you very much
so magic is a very introverted field
while scientists regularly publish their latest research we magicians do not like to share our methods and secrets
that 's true even amongst peers
but if you look at creative practice as a form of research or art as a form of r & amp d for humanity then how could a cyber illusionist like myself share his research
now my own speciality is combining digital technology and magic
and about three years ago i started an exercise in openness and inclusiveness by reaching out into the open-source software community to create new digital tools for magic tools that could eventually be shared with other artists to start them off further on in the process and to get them to the poetry faster
today i 'd like to show you something which came out of these collaborations
it 's an augmented reality projection tracking and mapping system or a digital storytelling tool
could we bring down the lights please thank you
so let 's give this a try
and i 'm going to use it to give you my take on the stuff of life
terribly sorry i forgot the floor
wake up
hey
come on
please
come on
ah sorry about that
forgot this
give it another try
okay
he figured out the system
uh oh
all right let 's try this
come on
hey
you heard her go ahead
bye-bye
thank you
slide into the shimmering surface between two worlds standing at the center of time as it uncurls cutting through the veil of illusion moving beyond past conclusions wondering if all my doubt and confusion will clear if i could be anywhere if i could be anywhere if i could be anywhere right now i would want to be here searching for the future among the things we 're throwing away trying to see the world through the junk we produce everyday they say nothing lasts forever but all the plastic ever made is still here and no amount of closing our eyes will make it disappear if i could be anywhere if i could be anywhere if i could be anywhere in history i would want to be here the romans the spanish the british the dutch american exceptionalism so out of touch the folly of empire repeating its course imposing its will and ruling by force on and on through time but the world can 't take it very much longer we 're not going to make it unless we 're smarter and stronger the world is going to shake itself free of our greed somehow if i could be anywhere if i could be anywhere in time if i could be anywhere and change things it would have to be now they say nothing last forever but all the plastic ever made is still here and no amount of closing our eyes will make it disappear and the world can 't take it very much longer we 're not going to make it unless we 're smarter and stronger the world 's gonna shake itself free of our greed somehow and the world can 't take it that you can see if the oceans don 't make it neither will we the world 's gonna shake itself all the way free somehow if i could be anywhere if i could be anywhere in time if i could be anywhere and change the outcome it would have to be now thank you
if you 're here today and i 'm very happy that you are you 've all heard about how sustainable development will save us from ourselves however when we 're not at ted we are often told that a real sustainability policy agenda is just not feasible especially in large urban areas like new york city
and that 's because most people with decision-making powers in both the public and the private sector really don 't feel as though they 're in danger
the reason why i 'm here today in part is because of a dog an abandoned puppy i found back in the rain back in 1998
she turned out to be a much bigger dog than i 'd anticipated
when she came into my life we were fighting against a huge waste facility planned for the east river waterfront despite the fact that our small part of new york city already handled more than 40 percent of the entire city 's commercial waste a sewage treatment pelletizing plant a sewage sludge plant four power plants the world 's largest food distribution center as well as other industries that bring more than 60,000 diesel truck trips to the area each week
the area also has one of the lowest ratios of parks to people in the city
so when i was contacted by the parks department about a $ 10,000 seed grant initiative seed grant initiative to help develop waterfront projects i thought they were really well-meaning but a bit naive
i 'd lived in this area all my life and you could not get to the river because of all the lovely facilities that i 'd mentioned earlier
then while jogging with my dog one morning she pulled me into what i thought was just another illegal dump
there were weeds and piles of garbage and other stuff that i won 't mention here but she kept dragging me and lo and behold at the end of that lot was the river
i knew that this forgotten little street-end abandoned like the dog that brought me there was worth saving
and i knew it would grow to become the proud beginnings of the community-led revitalization of the new south bronx
and just like my new dog it was an idea that got bigger than i 'd imagined
we garnered much support along the way
and the hunts point riverside park became the first waterfront park that the south bronx had had in more than 60 years
we leveraged that $ 10,000 seed grant more than 300 times into a $ 3 million park
and in the fall i 'm actually going to i exchange marriage vows with my beloved thank you very much
that 's him pressing my buttons back there which he does all the time
but those of us living in environmental justice communities are the canary in the coalmine we feel the problems right now and have for some time
environmental justice for those of you who may not be familiar with the term goes something like this no community should be saddled with more environmental burdens and less environmental benefits than any other
unfortunately race and class are extremely reliable indicators as to where one might find the good stuff like parks and trees and where one might find the bad stuff like power plants and waste facilities
as a black person in america i am twice as likely as a white person to live in an area where air pollution poses the greatest risk to my health
i am five times more likely to live within walking distance of a power plant or chemical facility which i do
these land-use decisions created the hostile conditions that lead to problems like obesity diabetes and asthma
why would someone leave their home to go for a brisk walk in a toxic neighborhood
our 27 percent obesity rate is high even for this country and diabetes comes with it
one out of four south bronx children has asthma
our asthma hospitalization rate is seven times higher than the national average
these impacts are coming everyone 's way
and we all pay dearly for solid waste costs health problems associated with pollution and more odiously the cost of imprisoning our young black and latino men who possess untold amounts of untapped potential
50 percent of our residents live at or below the poverty line
25 percent of us are unemployed low-income citizens often use emergency room visits as primary care
this comes at a high cost to taxpayers and produces no proportional benefits
poor people are not only still poor they are still unhealthy
fortunately there are many people like me who are striving for solutions that won 't compromise the lives of low-income communities of color in the short term and won 't destroy us all in the long term
none of us want that and we all have that in common so what else do we have in common
well first of all we 're all incredibly good-looking graduated high school college post-graduate degrees traveled to interesting places didn 't have kids in your early teens financially stable never been imprisoned ok
good
but besides being a black woman i am different from most of you in some other ways
i watched nearly half of the buildings in my neighborhood burn down
my big brother lenny fought in vietnam only to be gunned down a few blocks from our home
jesus i grew up with a crack house across the street
yeah i 'm a poor black child from the ghetto
these things make me different from you
but the things we have in common set me apart from most of the people in my community and i am in between these two worlds with enough of my heart to fight for justice in the other
so how did things get so different for us
in the late 40s my dad a pullman porter son of a slave bought a house in the hunts point section of the south bronx and a few years later he married my mom
at the time the community was a mostly white working-class neighborhood
my dad was not alone
and as others like him pursued their own version of the american dream white flight became common in the south bronx and in many cities around the country
red-lining was used by banks wherein certain sections of the city including ours were deemed off-limits to any sort of investment
many landlords believed it was more profitable to torch their buildings and collect insurance money rather than to sell under those conditions dead or injured former tenants notwithstanding
hunts point was formerly a walk-to-work community but now residents had neither work nor home to walk to
a national highway construction boom was added to our problems
in new york state robert moses spearheaded an aggressive highway expansion campaign
one of its primary goals was to make it easier for residents of wealthy communities in westchester county to go to manhattan
the south bronx which lies in between did not stand a chance
residents were often given less than a month 's notice before their buildings were razed
600,000 people were displaced
the common perception was that only pimps and pushers and prostitutes were from the south bronx
and if you are told from your earliest days that nothing good is going to come from your community that is bad and ugly how could it not reflect on you
so now my family 's property was worthless save for that it was our home and all we had
and luckily for me that home and the love inside of it along with help from teachers mentors and friends along the way was enough
now why is this story important
because from a planning perspective economic degradation begets environmental degradation which begets social degradation
the disinvestment that began in the 1960s set the stage for all the environmental injustices that were to come
antiquated zoning and land-use regulations are still used to this day to continue putting polluting facilities in my neighborhood
are these factors taken into consideration when land-use policy is decided
what costs are associated with these decisions and who pays
who profits does anything justify what the local community goes through
this was planning in quotes that did not have our best interests in mind
once we realized that we decided it was time to do our own planning
that small park i told you about earlier was the first stage of building a greenway movement in the south bronx
i wrote a one-and-a-quarter-million dollar federal transportation grant to design the plan for a waterfront esplanade with dedicated on-street bike paths
physical improvements help inform public policy regarding traffic safety the placement of the waste and other facilities which if done properly don 't compromise a community 's quality of life
they provide opportunities to be more physically active as well as local economic development
think bike shops juice stands
we secured 20 million dollars to build first-phase projects
this is lafayette avenue and as redesigned by matthews-nielsen landscape architects
and once this path is constructed it 'll connect the south bronx with more than 400 acres of randall 's island park
right now we 're separated by about 25 feet of water but this link will change that
as we nurture the natural environment its abundance will give us back even more
we run a project called the bronx ecological stewardship training which provides job training in the fields of ecological restorations so that folks from our community have the skills to compete for these well-paying jobs
little by little we 're seeding the area with green collar jobs then the people that have both a financial and personal stake in their environment
the sheridan expressway is an underutilized relic of the robert moses era built with no regard for the neighborhoods that were divided by it
even during rush hour it goes virtually unused
the community created an alternative transportation plan that allows for the removal of the highway
we have the opportunity now to bring together all the stakeholders to re-envision how this 28 acres can be better utilized for parkland affordable housing and local economic development
we also built the city 's new york city 's first green and cool roof demonstration project on top of our offices
cool roofs are highly reflective surfaces that don 't absorb solar heat and pass it on to the building or atmosphere
green roofs are soil and living plants
both can be used instead of petroleum-based roofing materials that absorb heat contribute to urban heat island effect and degrade under the sun which we in turn breathe green roofs also retain up to 75 percent of rainfall so they reduce a city 's need to fund costly end-of-pipe solutions which incidentally are often located in environmental justice communities like mine
and they provide habitats for our little friends
so so cool
anyway the demonstration project is a springboard for our own green roof installation business bringing jobs and sustainable economic activity to the south bronx
i like that too
anyway i know chris told us not to do pitches up here but since i have all of your attention we need investors end of pitch
it 's better to ask for forgiveness than permission
anyway ok katrina prior to katrina the south bronx and new orleans ninth ward had a lot in common both were largely populated by poor people of color both hotbeds of cultural innovation think hip-hop and jazz
both are waterfront communities that host both industries and residents in close proximity of one another
in the post-katrina era we have still more in common
we 're at best ignored and maligned and abused at worst by negligent regulatory agencies pernicious zoning and lax governmental accountability
neither the destruction of the ninth ward nor the south bronx was inevitable
but we have emerged with valuable lessons about how to dig ourselves out
we are more than simply national symbols of urban blight
or problems to be solved by empty campaign promises of presidents come and gone
now will we let the gulf coast languish for a decade or two like the south bronx did
or will we take proactive steps and learn from the homegrown resource of grassroots activists that have been born of desperation in communities like mine
now listen i do not expect individuals corporations or government to make the world a better place because it is right or moral
this presentation today only represents some of what i 've been through like a tiny little bit you 've no clue
but i 'll tell you later if you want to know
but i know it 's the bottom line or one 's perception of it that motivates people in the end
i 'm interested in what i like to call the triple bottom line that sustainable development can produce
developments that have the potential to create positive returns for all concerned the developers government and the community where these projects go up
at present that 's not happening in new york city
and we are operating with a comprehensive urban planning deficit
a parade of government subsidies is going to proposed big-box and stadium developments in the south bronx but there is scant coordination between city agencies on how to deal with the cumulative effects of increased traffic pollution solid waste and the impacts on open space and their approaches to local economic and job development are so lame it 's not even funny
because on top of that the world 's richest sports team is replacing the house that ruth built by destroying two well-loved community parks
now we 'll have even less than that stat i told you about earlier
and although less than 25 percent of south bronx residents own cars these projects include thousands of new parking spaces yet zip in terms of mass public transit
now what 's missing from the larger debate is a comprehensive cost-benefit analysis between not fixing an unhealthy environmentally challenged community versus incorporating structural sustainable changes
my agency is working closely with columbia university and others to shine a light on these issues
now let 's get this straight i am not anti-development
ours is a city not a wilderness preserve and i 've embraced my inner capitalist
you probably all have it and if you haven 't you need to
so i don 't have a problem with developers making money
there 's enough precedent out there to show that a sustainable community-friendly development can still make a fortune
fellow tedsters bill mcdonough and amory lovins both heroes of mine by the way have shown that you can actually do that
i do have a problem with developments that hyper-exploit politically vulnerable communities for profit
that it continues is a shame upon us all because we are all responsible for the future that we create
but one of the things i do to remind myself of greater possibilities is to learn from visionaries in other cities
this is my version of globalization
let 's take bogota poor latino surrounded by runaway gun violence and drug trafficking a reputation not unlike that of the south bronx
however this city was blessed in the late 1990s with a highly influential mayor named enrique penalosa
he looked at the demographics
few bogatanos own cars yet a huge portion of the city 's resources was dedicated to serving them
if you 're a mayor you can do something about that
his administration narrowed key municipal thoroughfares from five lanes to three outlawed parking on those streets expanded pedestrian walkways and bike lanes created public plazas created one of the most efficient bus mass-transit systems in the entire world
for his brilliant efforts he was nearly impeached
but as people began to see that they were being put first on issues reflecting their day-to-day lives incredible things happened
people stopped littering crime rates dropped because the streets were alive with people
his administration attacked several typical urban problems at one time and on a third-world budget at that
we have no excuse in this country i 'm sorry
but the bottom line is their people-first agenda was not meant to penalize those who could actually afford cars but rather to provide opportunities for all bogatanos to participate in the city 's resurgence that development should not come at the expense of the majority of the population is still considered a radical idea here in the us
but bogota 's example has the power to change that
you however are blessed with the gift of influence
that 's why you 're here and why you value the information we exchange
use your influence in support of comprehensive sustainable change everywhere
don 't just talk about it at ted this is a nationwide policy agenda i 'm trying to build and as you all know politics are personal
help me make green the new black help me make sustainability sexy
make it a part of your dinner and cocktail conversations
help me fight for environmental and economic justice
support investments with a triple-bottom-line return
help me democratize sustainability by bringing everyone to the table and insisting that comprehensive planning can be addressed everywhere
oh good glad i have a little more time
listen when i spoke to mr. gore the other day after breakfast i asked him how environmental justice activists were going to be included in his new marketing strategy
his response was a grant program
i don 't think he understood that i wasn 't asking for funding
i was making him an offer
what troubled me was that this top-down approach is still around
now don 't get me wrong we need money
but grassroots groups are needed at the table during the decision-making process
of the 90 percent of the energy that mr. gore reminded us that we waste every day don 't add wasting our energy intelligence and hard-earned experience to that count
i have come from so far to meet you like this
please don 't waste me by working together we can become one of those small rapidly growing groups of individuals who actually have the audacity and courage to believe that we actually can change the world
we might have come to this conference from very very different stations in life but believe me we all share one incredibly powerful thing we have nothing to lose and everything to gain
ciao bellos
so it was about four years ago five years ago i was sitting on a stage in philadelphia i think it was with a bag similar to this
and i was pulling a molecule out of this bag
and i was saying you don 't know this molecule really well but your body knows it extremely well
and i was thinking that your body hated it at the time because we are very immune to this this is called alpha-gal epitope
and the fact that pig heart valves have lots of these on them is the reason that you can 't transplant a pig heart valve into a person easily
actually our body doesn 't hate these
our body loves these it eats them
i mean the cells in our immune system are always hungry
and if an antibody is stuck to one of these things on the cell it means that 's food
now i was thinking about that and i said you know we 've got this immune response to this ridiculous molecule that we don 't make and we see it a lot in other animals and stuff
but i said we can 't get rid of it because all the people who tried to transplant heart valves found out you can 't get rid of that immunity
and i said why don 't you use that
what if i could stick this molecule slap it onto a bacteria that was pathogenic to me that had just invaded my lungs
i mean i could immediately tap into an immune response that was already there where it was not going to take five or six days to develop it it was going to immediately attack whatever this thing was on
it was kind of like the same thing that happens when you like when you 're getting stopped for a traffic ticket in l.a. and the cop drops a bag of marijuana in the back of your car and then charges you for possession of marijuana
it 's like this very fast very efficient way to get people off the street
so you can take a bacteria that really doesn 't make these things at all and if you could clamp these on it really well you have it taken off the street
and for certain bacteria we don 't have really efficient ways to do that anymore
our antibiotics are running out
and i mean the world apparently is running out too
so probably it doesn 't matter 50 years from now streptococcus and stuff like that will be rampant because we won 't be here but if we are we 're going to need something to do with the bacteria
so i started working with this thing with a bunch of collaborators
and trying to attach this to things that were themselves attached to certain specific target zones bacteria that we don 't like
and i feel now like george bush
it 's like mission accomplished
so i might be doing something dumb just like he was doing at the time
but basically what i was talking about there we 've now gotten to work
and it 's killing bacteria it 's eating them
this thing can be stuck like that little green triangle up there sort of symbolizing this right now
you can stick this to something called a dna aptamer
and that dna aptamer will attach specifically to a target that you have selected for it
so you can find a little feature on a bacterium that you don 't like like staphylococcus i don 't like it in particular because it killed a professor friend of mine last year
it doesn 't respond to antibiotics so i don 't like it
and i 'm making an aptamer that will have this attached to it
that will know how to find staph when it 's in your body and will alert your immune system to go after it
here 's what happened see that line on the very top with the little dots
that 's a bunch of mice that had been poisoned by our scientist friends down in texas at brooks air base with anthrax
and they had also been treated with a drug that we made that would attack anthrax in particular and direct your immune system to it
you 'll notice they all lived the ones on the top line that 's a 100 percent survival rate
and they actually lived another 14 days or 28 when we finally killed them and took them apart and figured out what went wrong
why did they not die
and they didn 't die because they didn 't have anthrax anymore
so we did it okay
mission accomplished
i still remember the day in school when our teacher told us that the world population had become three billion people and that was in 1960
i 'm going to talk now about how world population has changed from that year and into the future but i will not use digital technology as i 've done during my first five tedtalks
instead i have progressed and i am today launching a brand new analog teaching technology that i picked up from ike this box
this box contains one billion people
and our teacher told us that the industrialized world 1960 had one billion people
in the developing world she said they had two billion people
and they lived away then
there was a big gap between the one billion in the industrialized world and the two billion in the developing world
in the industrialized world people were healthy educated rich and they had small families
and their aspiration was to buy a car
and in 1960 all swedes were saving to try to buy a volvo like this
this was the economic level at which sweden was
but in contrast to this in the developing world far away the aspiration of the average family there was to have food for the day
they were saving to be able to buy a pair of shoes
there was an enormous gap in the world when i grew up
and this gap between the west and the rest has created a mindset of the world which we still use linguistically when we talk about the west and the developing world
but the world has changed and it 's overdue to upgrade that mindset and that taxonomy of the world and to understand it
and that 's what i 'm going to show you because since 1960 what has happened in the world up to 2010 is that a staggering four billion people have been added to the world population
just look how many
the world population has doubled since i went to school
and of course there 's been economic growth in the west
a lot of companies have happened to grow the economy so the western population moved over to here
and now their aspiration is not only to have a car
now they want to have a holiday on a very remote destination and they want to fly
so this is where they are today
and the most successful of the developing countries they have moved on you know and they have become emerging economies we call them
they are now buying cars
and what happened a month ago was that the chinese company geely they acquired the volvo company and then finally the swedes understood that something big had happened in the world
so there they are
and the tragedy is that the two billion over here that is struggling for food and shoes they are still almost as poor as they were 50 years ago
the new thing is that we have the biggest pile of billions the three billions here which are also becoming emerging economies because they are quite healthy relatively well-educated and they already also have two to three children per woman as those [ richer also ] have
and their aspiration now is of course to buy a bicycle and then later on they would like to have a motorbike also
but this is the world we have today no longer any gap
but the distance from the poorest here the very poorest to the very richest over here is wider than ever
but there is a continuous world from walking biking driving flying there are people on all levels and most people tend to be somewhere in the middle
this is the new world we have today in 2010
and what will happen in the future
well i 'm going to project into 2050
i was in shanghai recently and i listened to what 's happening in china and it 's pretty sure that they will catch up just as japan did
all the projections [ say that ] this one [ billion ] will [ only ] grow with one to two or three percent
[ but this second ] grows with seven eight percent and then they will end up here
they will start flying
and these lower or middle income countries the emerging income countries they will also forge forwards economically
and if but only if we invest in the right green technology so that we can avoid severe climate change and energy can still be relatively cheap then they will move all the way up here
and they will start to buy electric cars
this is what we will find there
so what about the poorest two billion
what about the poorest two billion here
will they move on
well here population [ growth ] comes in because there [ among emerging economies ] we already have two to three children per woman family planning is widely used and population growth is coming to an end
here [ among the poorest ] population is growing
so these [ poorest ] two billion will in the next decades increase to three billion and they will thereafter increase to four billion
there is nothing but a nuclear war of a kind we 've never seen that can stop this [ growth ] from happening
because we already have this [ growth ] in process
but if and only if [ the poorest ] get out of poverty they get education they get improved child survival they can buy a bicycle and a cell phone and come [ to live ] here then population growth will stop in 2050
we cannot have people on this level looking for food and shoes because then we get continued population growth
and let me show you why by converting back to the old-time digital technology
here i have on the screen my country bubbles
every bubble is a country the size is population
the colors show the continent
the yellow on there is the americas dark blue is africa brown is europe green is the middle east and this light blue is south asia
that 's india and this is china size is population
here i have children per woman two children four children six children eight children big families small families
the year is 1960
and down here child survival the percentage of children surviving childhood up to starting school 60 percent 70 percent 80 percent 90 and almost 100 percent as we have today in the wealthiest and healthiest countries
but look this is the world my teacher talked about in 1960 one billion western world here high child-survival small families and all the rest the rainbow of developing countries with very large families and poor child survival
what has happened i start the world here we go
can you see as the years pass by child survival is increasing
they get soap hygiene education vaccination penicillin and then family planning family size is decreasing
[ when ] they get up to 90-percent child survival then families decrease and most of the arab countries in the middle east is falling down there [ to small families ]
look bangladesh catching up with india
the whole emerging world joins the western world with good child survival and small family size but we still have the poorest billion
can you see the poorest billion those [ two ] boxes i had over here
they are still up here
and they still have a child survival of only 70 to 80 percent meaning that if you have six children born there will be at least four who survive to the next generation
and the population will double in one generation
so the only way of really getting world population [ growth ] to stop is to continue to improve child survival to 90 percent
that 's why investments by gates foundation unicef and aid organizations together with national government in the poorest countries are so good because they are actually helping us to reach a sustainable population size of the world
we can stop at nine billion if we do the right things
child survival is the new green
it 's only by child survival that we will stop population growth
and will it happen
well i 'm not an optimist neither am i a pessimist
i 'm a very serious possibilist
it 's a new category where we take emotion apart and we just work analytically with the world
it can be done
we can have a much more just world
with green technology and with investments to alleviate poverty and global governance the world can become like this
and look at the position of the old west
remember when this blue box was all alone leading the world living its own life
this will not happen [ again ]
the role of the old west in the new world is to become the foundation of the modern world nothing more nothing less
but it 's a very important role
do it well and get used to it
thank you very much
ladies and gentlemen gather around
i would love to share with you a story
once upon a time in 19th century germany there was the book
now during this time the book was the king of storytelling
it was venerable
it was ubiquitous
but it was a little bit boring
because in its 400 years of existence storytellers never evolved the book as a storytelling device
but then one author arrived and he changed the game forever
his name was lothar lothar meggendorfer
lothar meggendorfer put his foot down and he said genug ist genug
he grabbed his pen he snatched his scissors
this man refused to fold to the conventions of normalcy and just decided to fold
history would know lothar meggendorfer as who else the world 's first true inventor of the children 's pop-up book
for this delight and for this wonder people rejoiced
they were happy because the story survived and that the world would keep on spinning
lothar meggendorfer wasn 't the first to evolve the way a story was told and he certainly wasn 't the last
whether storytellers realized it or not they were channeling meggendorfer 's spirit when they moved opera to vaudville radio news to radio theater film to film in motion to film in sound color 3d on vhs and on dvd
there seemed to be no cure for this meggendorferitis
and things got a lot more fun when the internet came around
because not only could people broadcast their stories throughout the world but they could do so using what seemed to be an infinite amount of devices
for example one company would tell a story of love through its very own search engine
one taiwanese production studio would interpret american politics in 3d
and one man would tell the stories of his father by using a platform called twitter to communicate the excrement his father would gesticulate
and after all this everyone paused they took a step back
they realized that in 6,000 years of storytelling they 've gone from depicting hunting on cave walls to depicting shakespeare on facebook walls
and this was a cause for celebration
the art of storytelling has remained unchanged
and for the most part the stories are recycled
but the way that humans tell the stories has always evolved with pure consistent novelty
and they remembered a man one amazing german every time a new storytelling device popped up next
and for that the audience the lovely beautiful audience would live happily ever after
b.j. was one of many fellow inmates who had big plans for the future
he had a vision when he got out he was going to leave the dope game for good and fly straight and he was actually working on merging his two passions into one vision
he 'd spent 10,000 dollars to buy a website that exclusively featured women having sex on top of or inside of luxury sports cars
it was my first week in federal prison and i was learning quickly that it wasn 't what you see on tv
in fact it was teeming with smart ambitious men whose business instincts were in many cases as sharp as those of the ceos who had wined and dined me six months earlier when i was a rising star in the missouri senate
now 95 percent of the guys that i was locked up with had been drug dealers on the outside but when they talked about what they did they talked about it in a different jargon but the business concepts that they talked about weren 't unlike those that you 'd learn in a first year mba class at wharton promotional incentives you never charge a first-time user focus-grouping new product launches territorial expansion
but they didn 't spend a lot of time reliving the glory days
for the most part everyone was just trying to survive
it 's a lot harder than you might think
contrary to what most people think people don 't pay taxpayers don 't pay for your life when you 're in prison you 've got to pay for your own life
you 've got to pay for your soap your deodorant toothbrush toothpaste all of it
and it 's hard for a couple of reasons
first everything 's marked up 30 to 50 percent from what you 'd pay on the street and second you don 't make a lot of money
i unloaded trucks that was my full-time job unloading trucks at a food warehouse for $ 5.25 not an hour but per month
so how do you survive
well you learn to hustle all kinds of hustles
there 's legal hustles
you pay everything in stamps those are the currency
you charge another inmate to clean his cell
there 's sort of illegal hustles like you run a barbershop out of your cell
there 's pretty illegal hustles you run a tattoo parlor out of your own cell
and there 's very illegal hustles which you smuggle in you get smuggled in drugs pornography cell phones and just as in the outer world there 's a risk-reward tradeoff so the riskier the enterprise the more profitable it can potentially be
you want a cigarette in prison three to five dollars
you want an old-fashioned cell phone that you flip open and is about as big as your head three hundred bucks
you want a dirty magazine
well it can be as much as 1,000 dollars
so as you can probably tell one of the defining aspects of prison life is ingenuity
whether it was concocting delicious meals from stolen scraps from the warehouse sculpting people 's hair with toenail clippers or constructing weights from boulders in laundry bags tied on to tree limbs prisoners learn how to make do with less and many of them want to take this ingenuity that they 've learned to the outside and start restaurants barber shops personal training businesses
but there 's no training nothing to prepare them for that no rehabilitation at all in prison no one to help them write a business plan figure out a way to translate the business concepts they intuitively grasp into legal enterprises no access to the internet even
and then when they come out most states don 't even have a law prohibiting employers from discriminating against people with a background
so none of us should be surprised that two out of three ex-offenders re-offend within five years
look i lied to the feds i lost a year of my life from it
but when i came out i vowed that i was going to do whatever i could to make sure that guys like the ones i was locked up with didn 't have to waste any more of their life than they already had
so i hope that you 'll think about helping in some way
the best thing we can do is figure out ways to nurture the entrepreneurial spirit and the tremendous untapped potential in our prisons because if we don 't they 're not going to learn any new skills that 's going to help them and they 'll be right back
all they 'll learn on the inside is new hustles
thank you
how many of you have checked your email today
come on raise your hands
how many of you are checking it right now
and how about finances anybody check that today
credit card investment account
how about this week
now how about your household energy use
anybody check that today
this week last week
a few energy geeks spread out across the room
it 's good to see you guys
but the rest of us this is a room filled with people who are passionate about the future of this planet and even we aren 't paying attention to the energy use that 's driving climate change
the woman in the photo with me is harriet
we met her on our first family vacation
harriet 's paying attention to her energy use and she is decidedly not an energy geek
this is the story of how harriet came to pay attention
this is coal the most common source of electricity on the planet and there 's enough energy in this coal to light this bulb for more than a year
but unfortunately between here and here most of that energy is lost to things like transmission leakage and heat
in fact only 10 percent ends up as light
so this coal will last a little bit more than a month
if you wanted to light this bulb for a year you 'd need this much coal
the bad news here is that for every unit of energy we use we waste nine
that means there 's good news because for every unit of energy we save we save the other nine
so the question is how can we get the people in this room and across the globe to start paying attention to the energy we 're using and start wasting less of it
the answer comes from a behavioral science experiment that was run one hot summer 10 years ago and only 90 miles from here in san marcos california
graduate students put signs on every door in a neighborhood asking people to turn off their air conditioning and turn on their fans
one quarter of the homes received a message that said did you know you could save 54 dollars a month this summer
turn off your air conditioning turn on your fans
another group got an environmental message
and still a third group got a message about being good citizens preventing blackouts
most people guessed that money-saving message would work best of all
in fact none of these messages worked
they had zero impact on energy consumption
it was as if the grad students hadn 't shown up at all
but there was a fourth message and this message simply said when surveyed 77 percent of your neighbors said that they turned off their air conditioning and turned on their fans
please join them turn off your air conditioning and turn on your fans
and wouldn 't you know it they did
the people who received this message showed a marked decrease in energy consumption simply by being told what their neighbors were doing
so what does this tell us
well if something is inconvenient even if we believe in it moral suasion financial incentives don 't do much to move us but social pressure that 's powerful stuff
and harnessed correctly it can be a powerful force for good
in fact it already is
inspired by this insight my friend dan yates and i started a company called opower
we built software and partnered with utility companies who wanted to help their customers save energy
we deliver personalized home energy reports that show people how their consumption compares to their neighbors in similar-sized homes
just like those effective door hangers we have people comparing themselves to their neighbors and then we give everyone targeted recommendations to help them save
we started with paper we moved to a mobile application web and now even a controllable thermostat and for the last five years we 've been running the largest behavioral science experiment in the world
and it 's working
ordinary homeowners and renters have saved more than 250 million dollars on their energy bills and we 're just getting started
this year alone in partnership with more than 80 utilities in six countries we 're going to generate another two terawatt hours of electricity savings
now the energy geeks in the room know two terawatt hours but for the rest of us two terawatt hours is more than enough energy to power every home in st. louis and salt lake city combined for more than a year
two terawatt hours it 's roughly half what the u.s. solar industry produced last year
and two terawatt hours in terms of coal we 'd need to burn 34 of these wheelbarrows every minute around the clock every day for an entire year to get two terawatt hours of electricity
and we 're not burning anything
we 're just motivating people to pay attention and change their behavior
but we 're just one company and this is just scratching the surface
twenty percent of the electricity in homes is wasted and when i say wasted i don 't mean that people have inefficient lightbulbs they may
i mean we leave the lights on in empty rooms and we leave the air conditioning on when nobody 's home
that 's 40 billion dollars a year wasted on electricity that does not contribute to our well-being but does contribute to climate change
that 's 40 billion with a b every year in the u.s. alone
that 's half our coal usage right there
now thankfully some of the world 's best material scientists are looking to replace coal with sustainable resources like these and this is both fantastic and essential
but the most overlooked resource to get us to a sustainable energy future it isn 't on this slide
it 's in this room it 's you and it 's me
and we can harness this resource with no new material science simply by applying behavioral science
we can do it today we know it works and it will save us money right away
so what are we waiting for
well in most places utility regulation hasn 't changed much since thomas edison
utilities are still rewarded when their customers waste energy
they ought to be rewarded for helping their customers save it
but this story is much more than about household energy use
take a look at the prius
it 's efficient not only because toyota invested in material science but because they invested in behavioral science
the dashboard that shows drivers how much energy they 're saving in real time makes former speed demons drive more like cautious grandmothers
which brings us back to harriet
we met her on our first family vacation
she came over to meet my young daughter and she was tickled to learn that my daughter 's name is also harriet
she asked me what i did for a living and i told her i work with utilities to help people save energy
it was then that her eyes lit up
she looked at me and she said you 're exactly the person i need to talk to
you see two weeks ago my husband and i got a letter in the mail from our utility
it told us we were using twice as much energy as our neighbors
and for the last two weeks all we can think about talk about and even argue about is what we should be doing to save energy
we did everything that letter told us to do and still i know there must be more
now i 'm here with a genuine expert
tell me what should i do to save energy
there are many experts who can help answer harriet 's question
my goal is to make sure we are all asking it
thank you
you learned how to be a diver put on a mask and believe gather a dinner of shells for me take the tank down so you can breathe below movements slow you are an island all the secrets until then pried open i held them until they were still until they were still until they were still dream time i will find you you are shady you are new i 'm not so good at mornings i can see too clearly i prefer the nighttime dark and blurry falling night hovering light calling night hovering light in the moontime i will give up my life and in the deep dreams you will find me [ excerpts from myth and infrastructure ] come back

i always wanted to become a walking laboratory of social engagement to resonate other people 's feelings thoughts intentions motivations in the act of being with them
as a scientist i always wanted to measure that resonance that sense of the other that happens so quickly in the blink of an eye
we intuit other people 's feelings
we know the meaning of their actions even before they happen
we 're always in this stance of being the object of somebody else 's subjectivity
we do that all the time we just can 't shake it off
it 's so important that the very tools that we use to understand ourselves to understand the world around them is shaped by that stance
we are social to the core
so my journey in autism really started when i lived in a residential unit for adults with autism
most of those individuals had spent most of their lives in long-stay hospitals this is a long time ago
and for them autism was devastating
they had profound intellectual disabilities
they didn 't talk but most of all they were extraordinarily isolated from the world around them from their environment and from the people
in fact at the time if you walked into a school for individuals with autism you 'd hear a lot of noise plenty of commotion actions people doing things but they 're always doing things by themselves
so they may be looking at a light in the ceiling or they may be isolated in the corner or they might be engaged in these repetitive movements in self-stimulatory movements that led them nowhere
extremely extremely isolated
well now we know that autism is this disruption the disruption of this resonance that i am telling you
these are survival skills
these are survival skills that we inherited over many many hundreds of thousands of years of evolution
you see babies are born in a state of utter fragility
without the caregiver they wouldn 't survive so it stands to reason that nature would endow them with these mechanisms of survival
they orient to the caregiver
from the first days and weeks of life babies prefer to hear human sounds rather than just sounds in the environment
they prefer to look at people rather than at things and even as they 're looking at people they look at people 's eyes because the eye is the window to the other person 's experiences so much so that they even prefer to look at people who are looking at them rather than people who are looking away
well they orient to the caregiver
the caregiver seeks the baby
and it 's out of this mutually reinforcing choreography that a lot that is of importance to the emergence of mind the social mind the social brain depends on
we always think about autism as something that happens later on in life
it doesn 't it begins with the beginning of life
as babies engage with caregivers they soon realize that well there is something in between the ears that is very important it 's invisible you can 't see but is really critical and that thing is called attention
and they learn soon enough even before they can utter one word that they can take that attention and move somewhere in order to get things they want
they also learn to follow other people 's gaze because whatever people are looking at is what they are thinking about
and soon enough they start to learn about the meaning of things because when somebody is looking at something or somebody is pointing at something they 're not just getting a directional cue they are getting the other person 's meaning of that thing the attitude and soon enough they start building this body of meanings but meanings that were acquired within the realm of social interaction
those are meanings that are acquired as part of their shared experiences with others
well this is a little 15-month-old little girl and she has autism
and i am coming so close to her that i am maybe two inches from her face and she 's quite oblivious to me
imagine if i did that to you and i came two inches from your face
you 'd do probably two things wouldn 't you
you would recoil you would call the police
you would do something because it 's literally impossible to penetrate somebody 's physical space and not get a reaction
we do so remember intuitively effortlessly
this is our body wisdom it 's not something that is mediated by our language our body just knows that and we 've known that for a long time
and this is not something that happens to humans only
it happens to some of our phylatic cousins because if you 're a monkey and you look at another monkey and that monkey has a higher hierarchy position than you and that is considered to be a signal or threat well you are not going to be alive for long
so something that in other species are survival mechanisms without them they wouldn 't basically live we bring into the context of human beings and this is what we need to simply act act socially
now she is oblivious to me and i am so close to her and you think maybe she can see you maybe she can hear you
well a few minutes later she goes to the corner of the room and she finds a tiny little piece of candy an m & amp m .
so i could not attract her attention but something a thing did
now most of us make a big dichotomy between the world of things and the world of people
now for this girl that division line is not so clear and the world of people is not attracting her as much as we would like
now remember that we learn a great deal by sharing experiences
now what she is doing right now is that her path of learning is diverging moment by moment as she is isolating herself further and further
so we feel sometimes that the brain is deterministic the brain determines who we are going to be
but in fact the brain also becomes who we are and at the same time that her behaviors are taking away from the realm of social interaction this is what 's happening with her mind and this is what 's happening with her brain
well autism is the most strongly genetic condition of all developmental disorders and it 's a brain disorder
it 's a disorder that begins much prior to the time that the child is born
we now know that there is a very broad spectrum of autism
there are those individuals who are profoundly intellectually disabled but there are those that are gifted
there are those individuals who don 't talk at all
there are those individuals who talk too much
there are those individuals that if you observe them in their school you see them running the periphery fence of the school all day if you let them to those individuals who cannot stop coming to you and trying to engage you repeatedly relentlessly but often in an awkward fashion without that immediate resonance
well this is much more prevalent than we thought at the time
when i started in this field we thought that there were four individuals with autism per 10,000 a very rare condition
well now we know it 's more like one in 100
there are millions of individuals with autism all around us
the societal cost of this condition is huge
in the u.s. alone maybe 35 to 80 billion dollars and you know what most of those funds are associated with adolescents and particularly adults who are severely disabled individuals who need wrap-around services services that are very very intensive and those services can cost in excess of 60 to 80,000 dollars a year
those are individuals who did not benefit from early treatment because now we know that autism creates itself as they diverge in that pathway of learning that i mentioned to you
were we to be able to identify this condition at an earlier point and intervene and treat i can tell you and this has been probably something that has changed my life in the past 10 years this notion that we can absolutely attenuate this condition
also we have a window of opportunity because the brain is malleable for just so long and that window of opportunity happens in the first three years of life
it 's not that that window closes it doesn 't
but it diminishes considerably
and yet the median age of diagnosis in this country is still about five years and in disadvantaged populations the populations that don 't have access to clinical services rural populations minorities the age of diagnosis is later still which is almost as if i were to tell you that we are condemning those communities to have individuals with autism whose condition is going to be more severe
so i feel that we have a bio-ethical imperative
the science is there but no science is of relevance if it doesn 't have an impact on the community and we just can 't afford that missed opportunity because children with autism become adults with autism and we feel that those things that we can do for these children for those families early on will have lifetime consequences for the child for the family and for the community at large
so this is our view of autism
there are over a hundred genes that are associated with autism in fact we believe that there are going to be something between 300 and 600 genes associated with autism and genetic anomalies much more than just genes
and we actually have a bit of a question here because if there are so many different causes of autism how do you go from those liabilities to the actual syndrome because people like myself when we walk into a playroom we recognize a child as having autism
so how do you go from multiple causes to a syndrome that has some homogeneity
and the answer is what lies in between which is development
and in fact we are very interested in those first two years of life because those liabilities don 't necessarily convert into autism
autism creates itself
were we to be able to intervene during those years of life we might attenuate for some and god knows maybe even prevent for others
so how do we do that
how do we enter that feeling of resonance how do we enter another person 's being
i remember when i interacted with that 15-month-older that the thing that came to mind was how do you come into her world
is she thinking about me is she thinking about others
well it 's hard to do that so we had to create the technologies we had to basically step inside a body
we had to see the world through her eyes
and so in the past many years we 've been building these new technologies that are based on eye tracking
we can see moment by moment what children are engaging with
well this is my colleague warren jones with whom we 've been building these methods these studies for the past 12 years and you see there a happy five-month-older it 's a five-month little boy who is going to watch things that are brought from his world his mom the caregiver but also experiences that he would have were he to be in his daycare
what we want is to embrace that world and bring it into our laboratory but in order for us to do that we had to create these very sophisticated measures measures of how people how little babies how newborns engage with the world moment by moment what is important and what is not
well we created those measures and here what you see is what we call a funnel of attention
you 're watching a video
those frames are separated by about a second through the eyes of 35 typically developing two-year-olds and we freeze one frame and this is what the typical children are doing
in this scan pass in green here are two-year-olds with autism
so on that frame the children who are typical are watching this the emotion of expression of that little boy as he 's fighting a little bit with the little girl
what are the children with autism doing
they are focusing on the revolving door opening and shutting
well i can tell you that this divergence that you 're seeing here doesn 't happen only in our five-minute experiment
it happens moment by moment in their real lives and their minds are being formed and their brains are being specialized in something other than what is happening with their typical peers
well we took a construct from our pediatrician friends the concept of growth charts
you know when you take a child to the pediatrician and so you have physical height and weight
well we decided that we 're going to create growth charts of social engagement and we sought children from the time that they are born and what you see here on the x-axis is two three four five six months and nine until about the age of 24 months and this is the percent of their viewing time that they are focusing on people 's eyes and this is their growth chart
they start over here they love people 's eyes and it remains quite stable
it sort of goes up a little bit in those initial months
now let 's see what 's happening with babies who became autistic
it 's something very different
it starts way up here but then it 's a free fall
it 's very much like they brought into this world the reflex that orients them to people but it has no traction
it 's almost as if that stimulus you you 're not exerting influence on what happens as they navigate their daily lives
now we thought that those data were so powerful in a way that we wanted to see what happened in the first six months of life because if you interact with a two- and a three-month-older you 'd be surprised by how social those babies are
and what we see in the first six months of life is that those two groups can be segregated very easily
and using these kinds of measures and many others what we found out is that our science could in fact identify this condition early on
we didn 't have to wait for the behaviors of autism to emerge in the second year of life
if we measured things that are evolutionarily highly conserved and developmentally very early emerging things that are online from the first weeks of life we could push the detection of autism all the way to those first months and that 's what we are doing now
now we can create the very best technologies and the very best methods to identify the children but this would be for naught if we didn 't have an impact on what happens in their reality in the community
now we want those devices of course to be deployed by those who are in the trenches our colleagues the primary care physicians who see every child and we need to transform those technologies into something that is going to add value to their practice because they have to see so many children
and we want to do that universally so that we don 't miss any child but this would be immoral if we also did not have an infrastructure for intervention for treatment
we need to be able to work with the families to support the families to manage those first years with them we need to be able to really go from universal screening to universal access to treatment because those treatments are going to change these children 's and those families lives
now when we think about what we [ can ] do in those first years i can tell you having been in this field for so long one feels really rejuvenated
there is a sense that the science that one worked on can actually have an impact on realities preventing in fact those experiences that i really started in my journey in this field
i thought at the time that this was an intractable condition
no longer we can do a great deal of things
and the idea is not to cure autism
that 's not the idea
what we want is to make sure that those individuals with autism can be free from the devastating consequences that come with it at times the profound intellectual disabilities the lack of language the profound profound isolation
we feel that individuals with autism in fact have a very special perspective on the world and we need diversity and they can work extremely well in some areas of strength predictable situations situations that can be defined
because after all they learn about the world almost like about it rather than learning how to function in it
but this is a strength if you 're working for example in technology
and there are those individuals who have incredible artistic abilities
we want them to be free of that
we want that the next generations of individuals with autism will be able not only to express their strengths but to fulfill their promise
well thank you for listening to me
so here 's the good news about families
the last 50 years have seen a revolution in what it means to be a family
we have blended families adopted families we have nuclear families living in separate houses and divorced families living in the same house
but through it all the family has grown stronger
eight in 10 say the family they have today is as strong or stronger than the family they grew up in
now here 's the bad news
nearly everyone is completely overwhelmed by the chaos of family life
every parent i know myself included feels like we 're constantly playing defense
just when our kids stop teething they start having tantrums
just when they stop needing our help taking a bath they need our help dealing with cyberstalking or bullying
and here 's the worst news of all
our children sense we 're out of control
ellen galinsky of the families and work institute asked 1,000 children if you were granted one wish about your parents what would it be
the parents predicted the kids would say spending more time with them
they were wrong the kids number one wish
that their parents be less tired and less stressed
so how can we change this dynamic
are there concrete things we can do to reduce stress draw our family closer and generally prepare our children to enter the world
i spent the last few years trying to answer that question traveling around meeting families talking to scholars experts ranging from elite peace negotiators to warren buffett 's bankers to the green berets
i was trying to figure out what do happy families do right and what can i learn from them to make my family happier
i want to tell you about one family that i met and why i think they offer clues
at 7 p.m. on a sunday in hidden springs idaho where the six members of the starr family are sitting down to the highlight of their week the family meeting
the starrs are a regular american family with their share of regular american family problems
david is a software engineer eleanor takes care of their four children ages 10 to 15
one of those kids tutors math on the far side of town
one has lacrosse on the near side of town
one has asperger syndrome one has adhd
we were living in complete chaos eleanor said
what the starrs did next though was surprising
instead of turning to friends or relatives they looked to david 's workplace
they turned to a cutting-edge program called agile development that was just spreading from manufacturers in japan to startups in silicon valley
in agile workers are organized into small groups and do things in very short spans of time
so instead of having executives issue grand proclamations the team in effect manages itself
you have constant feedback you have daily update sessions
you have weekly reviews you 're constantly changing
david said when they brought this system into their home the family meetings in particular increased communication decreased stress and made everybody happier to be part of the family team
when my wife and i adopted these family meetings and other techniques into the lives of our then-five-year-old twin daughters it was the biggest single change we made since our daughters were born
and these meetings had this effect while taking under 20 minutes
so what is agile and why can it help with something that seems so different like families
in 1983 jeff sutherland was a technologist at a financial firm in new england
he was very frustrated with how software got designed
companies followed the waterfall method right in which executives issued orders that slowly trickled down to programmers below and no one had ever consulted the programmers
eighty-three percent of projects failed
they were too bloated or too out of date by the time they were done
sutherland wanted to create a system where ideas didn 't just percolate down but could percolate up from the bottom and be adjusted in real time
he read 30 years of harvard business review before stumbling upon an article in 1986 called the new new product development game
it said that the pace of business was quickening and by the way this was in 1986 and the most successful companies were flexible
it highlighted toyota and canon and likened their adaptable tight-knit teams to rugby scrums
as sutherland told me we got to that article and said that 's it
in sutherland 's system companies don 't use large massive projects that take two years
they do things in small chunks
nothing takes longer than two weeks
so instead of saying you guys go off into that bunker and come back with a cell phone or a social network you say you go off and come up with one element then bring it back let 's talk about it let 's adapt
you succeed or fail quickly
today agile is used in a hundred countries and it 's sweeping into management suites
inevitably people began taking some of these techniques and applying it to their families
you had blogs pop up and some manuals were written
even the sutherlands told me that they had an agile thanksgiving where you had one group of people working on the food one setting the table and one greeting visitors at the door
sutherland said it was the best thanksgiving ever
so let 's take one problem that families face crazy mornings and talk about how agile can help
a key plank is accountability so teams use information radiators these large boards in which everybody is accountable
so the starrs in adapting this to their home created a morning checklist in which each child is expected to tick off chores
so on the morning i visited eleanor came downstairs poured herself a cup of coffee sat in a reclining chair and she sat there kind of amiably talking to each of her children as one after the other they came downstairs checked the list made themselves breakfast checked the list again put the dishes in the dishwasher rechecked the list fed the pets or whatever chores they had checked the list once more gathered their belongings and made their way to the bus
it was one of the most astonishing family dynamics i have ever seen
and when i strenuously objected this would never work in our house our kids needed way too much monitoring eleanor looked at me
that 's what i thought she said
i told david keep your work out of my kitchen but i was wrong
so i turned to david so why does it work
he said you can 't underestimate the power of doing this
and he made a checkmark
he said in the workplace adults love it
with kids it 's heaven
the week we introduced a morning checklist into our house it cut parental screaming in half
but the real change didn 't come until we had these family meetings
so following the agile model we ask three questions what worked well in our family this week what didn 't work well and what will we agree to work on in the week ahead
everyone throws out suggestions and then we pick two to focus on
and suddenly the most amazing things started coming out of our daughters mouths
what worked well this week
getting over our fear of riding bikes making our beds
what didn 't work well our math sheets or greeting visitors at the door
like a lot of parents our kids are something like bermuda triangles
like thoughts and ideas go in but none ever comes out i mean at least not that are revealing
this gave us access suddenly to their innermost thoughts
but the most surprising part was when we turned to what are we going to work on in the week ahead
you know the key idea of agile is that teams essentially manage themselves and it works in software and it turns out that it works with kids
our kids love this process
so they would come up with all these ideas
you know greet five visitors at the door this week get an extra 10 minutes of reading before bed
kick someone lose desserts for a month
it turns out by the way our girls are little stalins
we constantly have to kind of dial them back
now look naturally there 's a gap between their kind of conduct in these meetings and their behavior the rest of the week but the truth is it didn 't really bother us
it felt like we were kind of laying these underground cables that wouldn 't light up their world for many years to come
three years later our girls are almost eight now we 're still holding these meetings
my wife counts them among her most treasured moments as a mom
so what did we learn
the word agile entered the lexicon in 2001 when jeff sutherland and a group of designers met in utah and wrote a 12-point agile manifesto
i think the time is right for an agile family manifesto
i 've taken some ideas from the starrs and from many other families i met
i 'm proposing three planks
plank number one adapt all the time
when i became a parent i figured you know what
we 'll set a few rules and we 'll stick to them
that assumes as parents we can anticipate every problem that 's going to arise
we can 't what 's great about the agile system is you build in a system of change so that you can react to what 's happening to you in real time
it 's like they say in the internet world if you 're doing the same thing today you were doing six months ago you 're doing the wrong thing
parents can learn a lot from that
but to me adapt all the time means something deeper too
we have to break parents out of this straitjacket that the only ideas we can try at home are ones that come from shrinks or self-help gurus or other family experts
the truth is their ideas are stale whereas in all these other worlds there are these new ideas to make groups and teams work effectively
let 's just take a few examples
let 's take the biggest issue of all family dinner
everybody knows that having family dinner with your children is good for the kids
but for so many of us it doesn 't work in our lives
i met a celebrity chef in new orleans who said no problem i 'll just time-shift family dinner
i 'm not home can 't make family dinner
we 'll have family breakfast we 'll meet for a bedtime snack
we 'll make sunday meals more important
and the truth is recent research backs him up
it turns out there 's only 10 minutes of productive time in any family meal
the rest of it 's taken up with take your elbows off the table and pass the ketchup
you can take that 10 minutes and move it to any part of the day and have the same benefit
so time-shift family dinner that 's adaptability
an environmental psychologist told me if you 're sitting in a hard chair on a rigid surface you 'll be more rigid
if you 're sitting on a cushioned chair you 'll be more open
she told me when you 're discipling your children sit in an upright chair with a cushioned surface
the conversation will go better
my wife and i actually moved where we sit for difficult conversations because i was sitting above in the power position
so move where you sit that 's adaptability
the point is there are all these new ideas out there
we 've got to hook them up with parents
so plank number one adapt all the time
be flexible be open-minded let the best ideas win
plank number two empower your children
our instinct as parents is to order our kids around
it 's easier and frankly we 're usually right
there 's a reason that few systems have been more waterfall over time than the family
but the single biggest lesson we learned is to reverse the waterfall as much as possible
enlist the children in their own upbringing
just yesterday we were having our family meeting and we had voted to work on overreacting
so we said okay give us a reward and give us a punishment okay
so one of my daughters threw out you get five minutes of overreacting time all week
so we kind of liked that
but then her sister started working the system
she said do i get one five-minute overreaction or can i get 10 30-second overreactions
i loved that spend the time however you want
now give us a punishment okay
if we get 15 minutes of overreaction time that 's the limit
every minute above that we have to do one pushup
so you see this is working now look this system isn 't lax
there 's plenty of parental authority going on
but we 're giving them practice becoming independent which of course is our ultimate goal
just as i was leaving to come here tonight one of my daughters started screaming
the other one said overreaction overreaction
and started counting and within 10 seconds it had ended
to me that is a certified agile miracle
and by the way research backs this up too
children who plan their own goals set weekly schedules evaluate their own work build up their frontal cortex and take more control over their lives
the point is we have to let our children succeed on their own terms and yes on occasion fail on their own terms
i was talking to warren buffett 's banker and he was chiding me for not letting my children make mistakes with their allowance
and i said but what if they drive into a ditch
he said it 's much better to drive into a ditch with a $ 6 allowance than a $ 60,000-a-year salary or a $ 6 million inheritance
so the bottom line is empower your children
plank number three tell your story
adaptability is fine but we also need bedrock
jim collins the author of good to great told me that successful human organizations of any kind have two things in common they preserve the core they stimulate progress
so agile is great for stimulating progress but i kept hearing time and again you need to preserve the core
so how do you do that
collins coached us on doing something that businesses do which is define your mission and identify your core values
so he led us through the process of creating a family mission statement
we did the family equivalent of a corporate retreat
we had a pajama party
i made popcorn actually i burned one so i made two
my wife bought a flip chart
and we had this great conversation like what 's important to us
what values do we most uphold
and we ended up with 10 statements
we are travelers not tourists
we don 't like dilemmas we like solutions
again research shows that parents should spend less time worrying about what they do wrong and more time focusing on what they do right worry less about the bad times and build up the good times
this family mission statement is a great way to identify what it is that you do right
a few weeks later we got a call from the school
one of our daughters had gotten into a spat
and suddenly we were worried like do we have a mean girl on our hands
and we didn 't really know what to do so we called her into my office
the family mission statement was on the wall and my wife said so anything up there seem to apply
and she kind of looked down the list and she said bring people together
suddenly we had a way into the conversation
another great way to tell your story is to tell your children where they came from
researchers at emory gave children a simple what do you know test
do you know where your grandparents were born
do you know where your parents went to high school
do you know anybody in your family who had a difficult situation an illness and they overcame it
the children who scored highest on this do you know scale had the highest self-esteem and a greater sense they could control their lives
the do you know test was the single biggest predictor of emotional health and happiness
as the author of the study told me children who have a sense of they 're part of a larger narrative have greater self-confidence
so my final plank is tell your story
spend time retelling the story of your family 's positive moments and how you overcame the negative ones
if you give children this happy narrative you give them the tools to make themselves happier
i was a teenager when i first read anna karenina and its famous opening sentence all happy families are alike
each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way
when i first read that i thought that sentence is inane
of course all happy families aren 't alike
but as i began working on this project i began changing my mind
recent scholarship has allowed us for the first time to identify the building blocks that successful families have
i 've mentioned just three here today adapt all the time empower the children tell your story
is it possible all these years later to say tolstoy was right
the answer i believe is yes
when leo tolstoy was five years old his brother nikolay came to him and said he had engraved the secret to universal happiness on a little green stick which he had hidden in a ravine on the family 's estate in russia
if the stick were ever found all humankind would be happy
tolstoy became consumed with that stick but he never found it
in fact he asked to be buried in that ravine where he thought it was hidden
he still lies there today covered in a layer of green grass
that story perfectly captures for me the final lesson that i learned happiness is not something we find it 's something we make
almost anybody who 's looked at well-run organizations has come to pretty much the same conclusion
greatness is not a matter of circumstance
it 's a matter of choice
you don 't need some grand plan you don 't need a waterfall
you just need to take small steps accumulate small wins keep reaching for that green stick
in the end this may be the greatest lesson of all
what 's the secret to a happy family try
thirteen trillion dollars in wealth has evaporated over the course of the last two years
we 've questioned the future of capitalism
we 've questioned the financial industry
we 've looked at our government oversight
we 've questioned where we 're going
and yet at the same time this very well may be a seminal moment in american history an opportunity for the consumer to actually take control and guide us to a new trajectory in america
i 'm calling this the great unwind
and the idea is a simple simple idea which is the fact that the consumer has moved from a state of anxiety to action
consumers who represent 72 percent of the gdp of america have actually started just like banks and just like businesses to de-leverage to unwind their leverage in daily life to remove themselves from the liability and risk that presents itself as we move forward
so to understand this and i 'm going to stress this it 's not about the consumer being in retreat
the consumer is empowered
in order to understand this we 're going to step back and look a little bit at what 's happened over the course of the last year and a half
so if you 've been gone this is the easy cliffsnotes on what 's happened in the economy okay
unemployment up housing values down equity markets down
commodity prices are like this
if you 're a mom trying to manage a budget and oil was 150 dollars a barrel last summer and it 's somewhere between 50 and 70 do you plan vacations how do you buy
what is your strategy in your household
will the bailout work we have national debt detroit currency valuations healthcare all these issues facing us
you put them all together you mix them up in a bouillabaisse and you have consumer confidence that 's basically a ticking time-bomb
in fact let 's go back and look at what caused this crisis because the consumer all of us in our daily lives actually contributed a large part to the problem
this is something i call the 50-20 paradox
it took us 50 years to reach annual savings ratings of almost 10 percent 50 years
do you know what this was right here
this was world war ii do you know why savings was so high
there was nothing to buy unless you wanted to buy some rivets right
so what happened though over the course of the last 20 years we went from a 10 percent savings rate to a negative savings rate
because we binged we bought extra-large cars supersized everything we bought remedies for restless leg syndrome
all these things together basically created a factor where the consumer sort of drove us headlong into the crisis that we face today
the personal debt-to-income ratio basically went from 65 percent to 135 percent in the span of about 15 years
so consumers got overleveraged
and of course our banks did as well as did our federal government
this is an absolutely staggering chart
it shows leverage trended out from 1919 to 2009
and what you end up seeing is the whole phenomenon of the fact that we are actually stepping forth and basically leveraging future education future children in our households
so if you look at this in the context of visualizing the bailout what you can see is if you stack up dollar bills first of all 360,000 dollars is about the size of a five-foot-four guy
but if you stack it up you just see this amazing staggering amount of dollars that have been put into the system to fund and bail us out
so this is the first 315 billion
but i read this fact the other day that one trillion seconds equals 32 thousand years so if you think about that the context the casualness with which we talk about trillion-dollar bailout here and trillion there we are stacking ourselves up for long-term leverage
however consumers have moved
they are taking responsibility
what we 're seeing is an uptake in the savings rate
in fact 11 straight months of savings have happened since the beginning of the crisis
we are working our way back up to that 10 percent
also remarkably in the fourth quarter spending dropped to its lowest level in 62 years almost a 3.7 percent decline
visa now reports that more people are using debit cards than they 're using credit cards
so we 're starting to pay for things with money that we have
and we 're starting to be much more careful about how we save and how we invest
but that 's not really the whole story
because this has also been a dramatic time of transformation
and you 've got to admit over the course of the last year and a half consumers have been doing some pretty weird things
it 's been pretty staggering what we 've lived through
if you take into account 80 percent of all americans were born after world war ii this is essentially our depression
and so as a result some crazy things have happened
i 'll give you some examples lets talk about dentists vasectomies guns and shark attacks okay
dentists report molars you know people grinding their teeth coming in and reporting the fact that they 've had stress
and so there is an increase in people having to have their fillings replaced
guns gun sales according to the fbi who does background checks are up almost 25 percent since january
vasectomies are up 48 percent according to the cornell institute
and lastly but a very good point hopefully not related to the former point i just made which is that shark attacks are at their lowest level from 2003
does anybody know why
no one is at the beach so there is a bright side to everything
but seriously what we see happening and the reason i want to stress that the consumer is not in retreat is that this is a tremendous opportunity for the consumer who drove us into this recession to lead us right back out
and what i mean by that is that we can move from mindless consumption to mindful consumption right
if you think about the last three decades the consumer has moved from savvy about marketing in the 90s to gathering all these amazing social and search tools in this decade but the one thing that has been holding them back is the ability to discriminate
by restricting their demand consumers can actually align their values with their spending and drive capitalism and business to not just be about more but be about better
we 're going to explain that right now
based on y & amp r 's brandasset valuator proprietary tool of vml and young & amp rubicam we set out to understand what 's been happening in the crisis with the consumer marketplace
we found a couple of really interesting things
we 're going to go through four value-shifts that we see driving new consumer behaviors that offer new management principles
the first cultural value shift that we see is this tendency toward something we call liquid life
this is the movement from americans defining their success on having things to having liquidity because the less excess that you have around you the more nimble and fleet of foot you are
as a result déclassé consumption is in
déclassé consumption is the whole idea that spending money frivolously makes you look a little bit anti-fashion
the management principle is dollars and cents
so let 's look at some examples of this déclassé consumption that falls out of this value
first things is we see something must be happening when p. diddy vows to tone down his bling
but seriously we also have this phenomenon on madison avenue and in other places where people are actually walking out of luxury boutiques with ordinary sort of generic paper bags to hide the brand purchases
we see high-end haggling in fashion today
high-end haggling for luxury and real estate
we also see just a relaxing of ego and sort of a dismantling of artifice
this is a story on the yacht club that 's all basically blue collar
blue-collar yacht club where you can join the yacht club but you 've got to work in the boat yard as sort of condition of membership
we also see the trend toward tourism that 's a little bit more low key right
agritourism going to vineyards and going to farms
and then we also see this movement forward from dollars and cents
what businesses can do to connect with these new mindsets is really interesting
a couple things that are kind of cool
one is that frito-lay figured out this liquidity thing with their consumer
they found their consumer had more money at the beginning of the month less at the end of the month so what they did is they started to change their packaging
larger packs at the beginning of the month smaller packaging at the end of the month
really interestingly too was the san francisco giants
they 've just instituted dynamic pricing
so it takes into account everything from the pitcher match-ups to the weather to the team records in setting prices for the consumer
another quick example of these types of movements is the rise of zynga
zynga has risen on the consumer 's desire to not want to be locked in to fixed-cost
again this theme is about variable cost variable living
so micropayments have become huge
and lastly some people are using hulu actually as a device to get rid of their cable bill
so really clever ideas there that are kind of being taken ahold and marketers are starting to understand
the second of the four values is this movement toward ethics and fair play
we see that play itself out with empathy and respect
the consumer is demanding it
and as a result businesses must provide not only value but values
increasingly consumers are looking at the culture of the company looking for their conduct in the marketplace
so what we see with empathy and respect lots of really hopeful things that have come out of this recession
and i 'll give you a few examples
one is the rise toward communities and neighborhoods and increased emphasis on your neighbors as your support system
also a wonderful byproduct of sort of a really lousy thing which has been unemployment is a rise in volunteerism that 's been noted in our country
we also see the phenomenon some of you may have boomerang kids these are boomerang alumni where universities are actually reconnecting with alumni in helping them with jobs sharing skills and retraining
we also talked about character and professionalism
we had this miracle on the hudson in new york city you know in january and suddenly sully has become a key name on babycenter
so from a value and values standpoint what companies can do is connect in lots of different ways
microsoft is doing something wonderful
they are actually vowing to retrain two million americans with i.t. training using their existing infrastructure to do something good
also a really interesting company is gore-tex
gore-tex is all about personal accountability of their management and their employees to the point where they really kind of shun the idea of bosses
but they also talk about the fact that their executives all of their expense reports are put onto their company intranet for everyone to see
complete transparency
think twice before you have that bottle of wine
the third of the four laws of post-crisis consumerism is about durable living
we 're seeing on our data that consumers are realizing this is a marathon not a sprint
they are digging in and they 're looking for ways to extract value out of every purchase that they make
witness the fact that americans are holding on to their cars longer than ever before 9.4 years on average in march a record
we also see the fact that libraries have become a huge resource for america
did you know that 68 percent of americans now carry a library card
the highest percentage ever in our nation 's history
so what you see in this trend is also the accumulation of knowledge
continuing education is up
everything is focused on betterment and training and development and moving forward
we also see a big diy movement
i was fascinated to learn that 30 percent of all homes in america are actually built by owners
that includes cottages and the like but 30 percent
so people are getting their hands dirty they are rolling up their sleeves
they want these skills
we see that with the phenomenon of raising backyard hens and chickens and ducks and when you work out the math they say it doesn 't work but the principle is there that it 's about being sustainable and taking care of yourself
and then we look at the high line in new york city an excellent use of reimagining existing infrastructure for something good which is a brand new park in new york city
so what brands can do and companies is pay dividends to consumers be a brand that lasts offer transparency promise you 're going to be there beyond today 's sale
perfect example of that is patagonia
patagonia 's footprint chronicles basically goes through and tracks every product that they make and gives you social responsibility and helps you understand the ethics that are behind the product that they make
another great example is fidelity
rather than instant cash-back rewards on your credit or debit purchases this is about 529 rewards for your student education
or the interesting company sunrun
i love this company they 've created a consumer collective where they put solar panels on households and create a consumer-based utility where the electricity that they generate is basically pumped back out into the marketplace
so it 's a consumer driven co-op
so the fourth sort of post-crisis consumerism that we see is this movement about return to the fold
it 's incredibly important right now
trust is not parceled out as we all know
it 's now about connecting to your communities connecting to your social networks
in my book i talked about the fact that 72 percent of people trust what other people say about a brand or a company versus 15 percent on advertising
so in that respect cooperative consumerism has really taken off
this is about consumers working together to get what they want out of the marketplace
let 's look at a couple of quick examples
the artisanal movement is huge
everything about locally derived products and services supporting your local neighborhoods whether it 's cheeses wines and other products
also this rise of local currencies
realizing that it 's difficult to get loans in this environment you 're doing business with people you trust in your local markets
so this rise of this sort of local currency is another really interesting phenomenon
and then they did a recent report i thought was fascinating
they actually started in certain communities in the united states start to publish people 's electricity usage
and what they found out is when that was available for public record the people 's electricity usage in those communities dropped
then we also look at the idea of cow-pooling which is the whole phenomenon of consumers organizing together to buy meat from organic farms that they know is safe and controlled in the way that they want it to be controlled
and then there is this other really interesting movement that 's happened in california which is about carrot mobs
the traditional thing would be to boycott right
have a stick well why not have a carrot
so these are consumers organizing pooling their resources to incentify companies to do good
and then we look at what companies can do
this is all the opportunity about being a community organizer
you have to realize that you can 't fight and control this
you actually need to organize it
you need to harness it you need to give it meaning
and there is lots of really interesting examples here that we see
first is just the rise of the fact that zagat 's has actually moved out of and diversified from rating restaurants into actually rating healthcare
so what credentials does zagat 's have
well they have a lot because it 's their network of people right
so that becomes a very powerful force for them to make their brand more elastic
then you look at the phenomenon of kogi
this kogi doesn 't exist it 's a moving truck right
it 's a moving truck through l.a. and the only way you can find it is through twitter
or you look at johnson & amp johnson 's momversations
a phenomenal blog that 's been built up
where j & amp j basically is tapping into the power of mommy bloggers allowing them to basically create a forum where they can communicate and they can connect
and it 's also become a very very valuable sort of advertising revenue for j & amp j as well
this plus the fact that you 've got phenomenal work from ceos from ford to zappos connecting on twitter creating an open environment allowing their employees to be part of the process rather than hidden behind walls
you see this rising force in sort of total transparency and openness that companies are starting to adopt all because the consumer is demanding it
so when we look at this and we step back what i believe is that the crisis that exists today is definitely real
it 's been tremendously powerful for consumers
but at the same time this is also a tremendous opportunity
and the chinese character for crisis is actually the same side of the same coin
crisis equals opportunity
what we 're seeing with consumers right now is the ability for them to actually lead us forward out of this recession
so we believe that values-driven spending will force capitalism to be better
it will drive innovation
it will make longer-lasting products it will create better more intuitive customer service
it will give us the opportunity to connect with companies that share the values that we share
so when we look back and step out at this and see the beginning of these trends that we 're seeing in our data we see a very hopeful picture for the future of america
thank you very much
of the five senses vision is the one that i appreciate the most and it 's the one that i can least take for granted
i think this is partially due to my father who was blind
it was a fact that he didn 't make much of a fuss about usually
one time in nova scotia when we went to see a total eclipse of the sun yeah same one as in the carly simon song which may or may not refer to james taylor warren beatty or mick jagger we 're not really sure
they handed out these dark plastic viewers that allowed us to look directly at the sun without damaging our eyes
but dad got really scared he didn 't want us doing that
he wanted us instead to use these cheap cardboard viewers so that there was no chance at all that our eyes would be damaged
i thought this was a little strange at the time
what i didn 't know at the time was that my father had actually been born with perfect eyesight
when he and his sister martha were just very little their mom took them out to see a total eclipse or actually a solar eclipse and not long after that both of them started losing their eyesight
decades later it turned out that the source of their blindness was most likely some sort of bacterial infection
as near as we can tell it had nothing whatsoever to do with that solar eclipse but by then my grandmother had already gone to her grave thinking it was her fault
so dad graduated harvard in 1946 married my mom and bought a house in lexington massachusetts where the first shots were fired against the british in 1775 although we didn 't actually hit any of them until concord
he got a job working for raytheon designing guidance systems which was part of the route 128 high-tech axis in those days so the equivalent of silicone valley in the 70s
dad wasn 't a real militaristic kind of guy he just really felt bad that he wasn 't able to fight in world war ii on account of his handicap although they did let him get through the several-hour-long army physical exam before they got to the very last test which was for vision
so dad started racking up all of these patents and gaining a reputation as a blind genius rocket scientist inventor
but to us he was just dad and our home life was pretty normal
as a kid i watched a lot of television and had lots of nerdy hobbies like mineralogy and microbiology and the space program and a little bit of politics
i played a lot of chess
but at the age of 14 a friend of mine got me interested in comic books and i decided that was what i wanted to do for a living
so here 's my dad he 's a scientist he 's an engineer and he 's a military contractor
so he has four kids right
one grows up to become a computer scientist one grows up to join the navy one grows up to become an engineer and then there 's me the comic book artist
which incidentally makes me the opposite of dean kamen because i 'm a comic book artist son of an inventor and he 's an inventor son of a comic book artist
right it 's true
the funny thing is dad had a lot of faith in me
he had faith in my abilities as a cartoonist even though he had no direct evidence that i was any good whatsoever everything he saw was just a blur
now this gives a real meaning to the term blind faith which doesn 't have the same negative connotation for me that it does for other people
now faith in things which cannot be seen which cannot be proved is not the sort of faith that i 've ever really related to all that much
i tend to like science where what we see and can ascertain are the foundation of what we know
but there 's a middle ground too
a middle ground tread by people like poor old charles babbage and his steam-driven computers that were never built
nobody really understood what it was that he had in mind except for ada lovelace and he went to his grave trying to pursue that dream
vannevar bush with his memex this idea of all of human knowledge at your fingertips he had this vision
and i think a lot of people in his day probably thought he was a bit of a kook
and yeah we can look back in retrospect and say yeah ha-ha you know it 's all microfilm but that 's that 's not the point he understood the shape of the future
so did j.c.r. licklider and his notions for computer-human interaction
same thing he understood the shape of the future even though it was something that would only be implemented by people much later
or paul baran and his vision for packet switching
hardly anybody listened to him in his day
or even the people who actually pulled it off the people at bolt beranek and newman in boston who just would sketch out these structures of what would eventually become a worldwide network and sketching things on the back of napkins and on note papers and arguing over dinner at howard johnson 's on route 128 in lexington massachusetts just two miles from where i was studying the queen 's gambit deferred and listening to gladys knight & amp the pips singing midnight train to georgia while in my dad 's big easy chair you know
so three types of vision right
vision based on what one cannot see the vision of that unseen and unknowable
the vision of that which has already been proven or can be ascertained
and this third kind of vision of something which can be which may be based on knowledge but is as yet unproven
now we 've seen a lot of examples of people who are pursuing that sort of vision in science but i think it 's also true in the arts it 's true in politics it 's even true in personal endeavors
what it comes down to really is four basic principles learn from everyone follow no one watch for patterns and work like hell
i think these are the four principles that go into this
and it 's that third one especially where visions of the future begin to manifest themselves
what 's interesting is that this particular way of looking at the world is i think only one of four different ways that manifest themselves in different fields of endeavor
in comics i know that it results in sort of a formalist attitude towards trying to understand how it works
then there 's another more classical attitude which embraces beauty and craft
another one which believes in the pure transparency of content
and then another which emphasizes the authenticity of human experience and honesty and rawness
these are four very different ways of looking at the world i even gave them names
the classicist the animist and formalist and iconoclast
interestingly it seemed to correspond more or less to jung 's four subdivisions of human thought
and they reflect a dichotomy of art and delight on left and the right tradition and revolution on the top and the bottom
and if you go on the diagonal you get content and form and then beauty and truth
and it probably applies just as much to music and to movies and to fine art which has nothing whatsoever to do with vision at all or for that matter nothing to do with our conference theme of inspired by nature except to the extent of the fable of the frog who gives the ride to the scorpion on his back to get across the river because the scorpion promises not to sting him but then the scorpion does sting him anyway and they both die but not before the frog asks him why and the scorpion says because it 's my nature in that sense yes
so so this was my nature the thing was i saw that the route that i took to discovering this focus in my work and who i was i saw it as just this road to discovery
actually it was just me embracing my nature which means that i didn 't actually fall that far from the tree after all
so what does a scientific mind do in the arts
well i started making comics but i also started trying to understand them almost immediately
and one of the most important things about comics i discovered was that comics are a visual medium but they try to embrace all of the senses within it
so the different elements of comics like pictures and words and the different symbols and everything in between that comics presents are all funneled through the single conduit of vision
so you have things like resemblance where something which resembles the physical world can be abstracted in a couple of different directions abstracted from resemblance but still retaining the complete meaning or abstracted away from both resemblance and meaning towards the picture plan
put all these three together and you have a nice little map of the entire boundary of visual iconography which comics can embrace
and if you move to the right you also get language because that 's abstracting even further from resemblance but still maintaining meaning
vision is called upon to represent sound and to understand the common properties of those two and their common heritage as well
also to try to represent the texture of sound to capture its essential character through visuals
and there 's also a balance between the visible and the invisible in comics
comics is a kind of call and response in which the artist gives you something to see within the panels and then gives you something to imagine between the panels
also another sense which comics vision represents and that 's time
sequence is a very important aspect of comics
comics presents a kind of temporal map
and this temporal map was something that energizes modern comics but i was wondering if perhaps it also energizes other sorts of forms and i found some in history
and you can see this same principle operating in these ancient versions of the same idea
what 's happening is the art form is colliding with the given technology whether it 's paint on stone like the tomb of the scribe in ancient egypt or a bas-relief sculpture rising up a stone column or a 200-foot-long embroidery or painted deerskin and tree bark running across 88 accordion-folded pages
what 's interesting is once you hit print and this is from 1450 by the way all of the artifacts of modern comics start to present themselves rectilinear panel arrangements simple line drawings without tone and a left-to-right reading sequence
and within 100 years you already start to see word balloons and captions and it 's really just a hop skip and a jump from here to here
so i wrote a book about this in 93 but as i was finishing the book i had to do a little bit of typesetting and i was tired of going to my local copy shop to do it so i bought a computer
and it was just a little thing it wasn 't good for much except text entry but my father had told me about moore 's law about moore 's law back in the 70s and i knew what was coming
and so i kept my eyes peeled to see if the sort of changes that happened when we went from pre-print comics to print comics would happen when we went beyond to post-print comics
so one of the first things that were proposed was that we could mix the visuals of comics with the sound motion and interactivity of the cd-roms that were being made in those days
this was even before the web
and one of the first things they did was they tried to take the comics page as-is and transplant it to monitors which was a classic mcluhanesque mistake of appropriating the shape of the previous technology as the content of the new technology
and so what they would do is they 'd have these comic pages that resemble print comics pages and they would introduce all this sound and motion
the problem was that if you go with this idea this basic idea that space equals time in comics what happens is that when you introduce sound and motion which are temporal phenomena that can only be represented through time then they break with that continuity of presentation
interactivity was another thing
there were hypertext comics
but the thing about hypertext is that everything in hypertext is either here not here or connected to here it 's profoundly non-spatial
the distance from abraham lincoln to a lincoln penny the penny marshall to the marshall plan to plan 9 to nine lives it 's all the same
and but in comics in comics every aspect of the work every element of the work has a spatial relationship to every other element at all times
so the question was was there any way to preserve that spatial relationship while still taking advantage of all of the things that digital had to offer us
and i found my personal answer for this in those ancient comics that i was showing you
each of them has a single unbroken reading line whether it 's going zigzag across the walls or spiraling up a column or just straight left to right or even going in a backwards zigzag across those 88 accordion-folded pages
the same thing is happening and that is that the basic idea that as you move through space you move through time is being carried out without any compromise but there were compromises when print hit
adjacent spaces were no longer adjacent moments so the basic idea of comics was being broken again and again and again and again
and i thought o.k. well if that 's true is there any way when we go beyond today 's print to somehow bring that back
now the monitor is just as limited as the page technically right
it 's a different shape but other than that it 's the same basic limitation
but that 's only if you look at the monitor as a page but not if you look at the monitor as a window
and that 's what i proposed that perhaps we could create these comics on an infinite canvas along the x axis and the y axis and staircases
we could do circular narratives that were literally circular
we could do a turn in a story that was literally a turn
parallel narratives could be literally parallel
x y and also z .
so i had all these notions this was back in the late 90s and other people in my business thought i was pretty crazy but a lot of people then went on and actually did it
i 'm going to show you a couple now
this was an early collage comic by a fellow named jason lex
and notice what 's going on here
what i 'm searching for is a durable mutation that 's what all of us are searching for
as media head into this new era we are looking for mutations that are durable that have some sort of staying power
now we 're taking this basic idea of presenting comics in a visual medium and then we 're carrying it through all the way from beginning to end
that 's that entire comic you just saw is up on the screen right now
but even though we 're only experiencing it one piece at a time that 's just where the technology is right now
as the technology evolves as you get full immersive displays and whatnot this sort of thing will only grow
it will adapt it will adapt to its environment it 's a durable mutation
here 's another one i 'll show you this is by drew weing this is called pup contemplates the heat death of the universe
see what 's going on here as we draw these stories on an infinite canvas is you 're creating a more pure expression of what this medium is all about
we 'll go by this a little quickly you get the idea
i just want to get to the last panel
there we go
just one more
talk about your infinite canvas
it 's by a guy named daniel merlin goodbrey in britain
why is this important
i think this is important because media all media provide us a window back into our world
now it could be that motion pictures and eventually virtual reality or something equivalent to it some sort of immersive display is going to provide us with our most efficient escape from the world that we 're in
that 's why most people turn to storytelling is to escape
but media provides us with a window back into the world that we live in
and when media evolve so that the identity of the media becomes increasingly unique
because what you 're looking at is you 're looking at comics cubed you 're looking at comics that are more comics-like than they 've ever been before
when that happens you provide people with multiple ways of re-entering the world through different windows and when you do that it allows them to triangulate the world that they live in and see its shape
and that 's why i think this is important
one of many reasons but i 've got to go now
thank you for having me
so basically we have public leaders public officials who are out of control they are writing bills that are unintelligible and out of these bills are going to come maybe 40,000 pages of regulations total complexity which has a dramatically negative impact on our life
if you 're a veteran coming back from iraq or vietnam you face a blizzard of paperwork to get your benefits if you 're trying to get a small business loan you face a blizzard of paperwork
what are we going to do about it i define simplicity as a means to achieving clarity transparency and empathy building humanity into communications
i 've been simplifying things for 30 years
i come out of the advertising and design business
my focus is understanding you people and how you interact with the government to get your benefits how you interact with corporations to decide whom you 're going to do business with and how you view brands
so very quickly when president obama said i don 't see why we can 't have a one-page plain english consumer credit agreement
so i locked myself in a room figured out the content organized the document and wrote it in plain english
i 've had this checked by the two top consumer credit lawyers in the country
this is a real thing
now i went one step further and said why do we have to stick with the stodgy lawyers and just have a paper document let 's go online
and many people might need help in computation
working with the harvard business school you 'll see this example when you talk about minimum payment if you spent 62 dollars for a meal the longer you take to pay out that loan you see over a period of time using the minimum payment it 's 99 dollars and 17 cents
how about that do you think your bank is going to show that to people
but it 's going to work it 's more effective than just computational aids
and what about terms like over the limit
perhaps a stealth thing
define it in context tell people what it means
when you put it in plain english you almost force the institution to give the people a way a default out of that and not put themselves at risk
plain english is about changing the content
and one of the things i 'm most proud of is this agreement for ibm
it 's a grid it 's a calendar
at such and such a date ibm has responsibilities you have responsibilities
received very favorably by business
and there is some good news to report today
each year one in 10 taxpayers receives a notice from the irs
there are 200 million letters that go out
running through this typical letter that they had i ran it through my simplicity lab it 's pretty unintelligible
all the parts of the document in red are not intelligible
we looked at doing over 1,000 letters that cover 70 percent of their transactions in plain english
they have been tested in the laboratory
when i run it through my lab this heat-mapping shows everything is intelligible
and the irs has introduced the program
there are a couple of things going on right now that i want to bring to your attention
there is a lot of discussion now about a consumer financial protection agency how to mandate simplicity
we see all this complexity
it 's incumbent upon us and this organization i believe to make clarity transparency and empathy a national priority
there is no way that we should allow government to communicate the way they communicate
there is no way we should do business with companies that have agreements with stealth provisions and that are unintelligible
so how are we going to change the world
make clarity transparency and simplicity a national priority
i thank you

well arthur c. clarke a famous science fiction writer from the 1950s said that we overestimate technology in the short term and we underestimate it in the long term
and i think that 's some of the fear that we see about jobs disappearing from artificial intelligence and robots
that we 're overestimating the technology in the short term
but i am worried whether we 're going to get the technology we need in the long term
because the demographics are really going to leave us with lots of jobs that need doing and that we our society is going to have to be built on the shoulders of steel of robots in the future
so i 'm scared we won 't have enough robots
but fear of losing jobs to technology has been around for a long time
back in 1957 there was a spencer tracy katharine hepburn movie
so you know how it ended up spencer tracy brought a computer a mainframe computer of 1957 in to help the librarians
the librarians in the company would do things like answer for the executives what are the names of santa 's reindeer
and they would look that up
and this mainframe computer was going to help them with that job
well of course a mainframe computer in 1957 wasn 't much use for that job
the librarians were afraid their jobs were going to disappear
but that 's not what happened in fact
the number of jobs for librarians increased for a long time after 1957
it wasn 't until the internet came into play the web came into play and search engines came into play that the need for librarians went down
and i think everyone from 1957 totally underestimated the level of technology we would all carry around in our hands and in our pockets today
and we can just ask what are the names of santa 's reindeer and be told instantly or anything else we want to ask
by the way the wages for librarians went up faster than the wages for other jobs in the u.s. over that same time period because librarians became partners of computers
computers became tools and they got more tools that they could use and become more effective during that time
same thing happened in offices
back in the old days people used spreadsheets
spreadsheets were spread sheets of paper and they calculated by hand
but here was an interesting thing that came along
with the revolution around 1980 of p.c. s the spreadsheet programs were tuned for office workers not to replace office workers but it respected office workers as being capable of being programmers
so office workers became programmers of spreadsheets
it increased their capabilities
they no longer had to do the mundane computations but they could do something much more
now today we 're starting to see robots in our lives
on the left there is the packbot from irobot
when soldiers came across roadside bombs in iraq and afghanistan instead of putting on a bomb suit and going out and poking with a stick as they used to do up until about 2002 they now send the robot out
so the robot takes over the dangerous jobs
on the right are some tugs from a company called aethon in pittsburgh
these are in hundreds of hospitals across the u.s.
and they take the dirty sheets down to the laundry
they take the dirty dishes back to the kitchen
they bring the medicines up from the pharmacy
and it frees up the nurses and the nurse 's aides from doing that mundane work of just mechanically pushing stuff around to spend more time with patients
in fact robots have become sort of ubiquitous in our lives in many ways
but i think when it comes to factory robots people are sort of afraid because factory robots are dangerous to be around
in order to program them you have to understand six-dimensional vectors and quaternions
and ordinary people can 't interact with them
and i think it 's the sort of technology that 's gone wrong
it 's displaced the worker from the technology
and i think we really have to look at technologies that ordinary workers can interact with
and so i want to tell you today about baxter which we 've been talking about
and baxter i see as a way a first wave of robot that ordinary people can interact with in an industrial setting
so baxter is up here
this is chris harbert from rethink robotics
we 've got a conveyor there
and if the lighting isn 't too extreme ah ah there it is it 's picked up the object off the conveyor
it 's going to come bring it over here and put it down
and then it 'll go back reach for another object
the interesting thing is baxter has some basic common sense
by the way what 's going on with the eyes
the eyes are on the screen there
the eyes look ahead where the robot 's going to move
so a person that 's interacting with the robot understands where it 's going to reach and isn 't surprised by its motions
here chris took the object out of its hand and baxter didn 't go and try to put it down it went back and realized it had to get another one
it 's got a little bit of basic common sense goes and picks the objects
and baxter 's safe to interact with
you wouldn 't want to do this with a current industrial robot
but with baxter it doesn 't hurt
it feels the force understands that chris is there and doesn 't push through him and hurt him
but i think the most interesting thing about baxter is the user interface
and so chris is going to come and grab the other arm now
and when he grabs an arm it goes into zero-force gravity-compensated mode and graphics come up on the screen
you can see some icons on the left of the screen there for what was about its right arm
he 's going to put something in its hand he 's going to bring it over here press a button and let go of that thing in the hand
and the robot figures out ah he must mean i want to put stuff down
it puts a little icon there
he comes over here and he gets the fingers to grasp together and the robot infers ah you want an object for me to pick up
that puts the green icon there
he 's going to map out an area of where the robot should pick up the object from
it just moves it around and the robot figures out that was an area search
he didn 't have to select that from a menu
and now he 's going to go off and train the visual appearance of that object while we continue talking
so as we continue here i want to tell you about what this is like in factories
these robots we 're shipping every day
they go to factories around the country
this is mildred
mildred 's a factory worker in connecticut
she 's worked on the line for over 20 years
one hour after she saw her first industrial robot she had programmed it to do some tasks in the factory
she decided she really liked robots
and it was doing the simple repetitive tasks that she had had to do beforehand
now she 's got the robot doing it
when we first went out to talk to people in factories about how we could get robots to interact with them better one of the questions we asked them was do you want your children to work in a factory
the universal answer was no i want a better job than that for my children
and as a result of that mildred is very typical of today 's factory workers in the u.s.
they 're older and they 're getting older and older
there aren 't many young people coming into factory work
and as their tasks become more onerous on them we need to give them tools that they can collaborate with so that they can be part of the solution so that they can continue to work and we can continue to produce in the u.s.
and so our vision is that mildred who 's the line worker becomes mildred the robot trainer
she lifts her game like the office workers of the 1980s lifted their game of what they could do
we 're not giving them tools that they have to go and study for years and years in order to use
they 're tools that they can just learn how to operate in a few minutes
there 's two great forces that are both volitional but inevitable
that 's climate change and demographics
demographics is really going to change our world
this is the percentage of adults who are working age
and it 's gone down slightly over the last 40 years
but over the next 40 years it 's going to change dramatically even in china
the percentage of adults who are working age drops dramatically
and turned up the other way the people who are retirement age goes up very very fast as the baby boomers get to retirement age
that means there will be more people with fewer social security dollars competing for services
but more than that as we get older we get more frail and we can 't do all the tasks we used to do
if we look at the statistics on the ages of caregivers before our eyes those caregivers are getting older and older
that 's happening statistically right now
and as the number of people who are older above retirement age and getting older as they increase there will be less people to take care of them
and i think we 're really going to have to have robots to help us
and i don 't mean robots in terms of companions
i mean robots doing the things that we normally do for ourselves but get harder as we get older
getting the groceries in from the car up the stairs into the kitchen
or even as we get very much older driving our cars to go visit people
and i think robotics gives people a chance to have dignity as they get older by having control of the robotic solution
so they don 't have to rely on people that are getting scarcer to help them
and so i really think that we 're going to be spending more time with robots like baxter and working with robots like baxter in our daily lives and that we will here baxter it 's good
and that we will all come to rely on robots over the next 40 years as part of our everyday lives
thanks very much
when i was growing up in montana i had two dreams
i wanted to be a paleontologist a dinosaur paleontologist and i wanted to have a pet dinosaur
and so that 's what i 've been striving for all of my life
i was very fortunate early in my career
i was fortunate in finding things
i wasn 't very good at reading things
in fact i don 't read much of anything
i am extremely dyslexic and so reading is the hardest thing i do
but instead i go out and i find things
then i just pick things up
i basically practice for finding money on the street
and i wander about the hills and i have found a few things
and i have been fortunate enough to find things like the first eggs in the western hemisphere and the first baby dinosaurs in nests the first dinosaur embryos and massive accumulations of bones
and it happened to be at a time when people were just starting to begin to realize that dinosaurs weren 't the big stupid green reptiles that people had thought for so many years
people were starting to get an idea that dinosaurs were special
and so at that time i was able to make some interesting hypotheses along with my colleagues
we were able to actually say that dinosaurs based on the evidence we had that dinosaurs built nests and lived in colonies and cared for their young brought food to their babies and traveled in gigantic herds
so it was pretty interesting stuff
i have gone on to find more things and discover that dinosaurs really were very social
we have found a lot of evidence that dinosaurs changed from when they were juveniles to when they were adults
the appearance of them would have been different which it is in all social animals
in social groups of animals the juveniles always look different than the adults
the adults can recognize the juveniles the juveniles can recognize the adults
and so we 're making a better picture of what a dinosaur looks like
and they didn 't just all chase jeeps around
but it is that social thing that i guess attracted michael crichton
and in his book he talked about the social animals
and then steven spielberg of course depicts these dinosaurs as being very social creatures
the theme of this story is building a dinosaur and so we come to that part of jurassic park
michael crichton really was one of the first people to talk about bringing dinosaurs back to life
you all know the story right
i mean i assume everyone here has seen jurassic park
if you want to make a dinosaur you go out you find yourself a piece of petrified tree sap otherwise known as amber that has some blood-sucking insects in it good ones and you get your insect and you drill into it and you suck out some dna because obviously all insects that sucked blood in those days sucked dinosaur dna out
and you take your dna back to the laboratory and you clone it
and i guess you inject it into maybe an ostrich egg or something like that and then you wait and lo and behold out pops a little baby dinosaur
and everybody 's happy about that
and they 're happy over and over again
they keep doing it they just keep making these things
and then then then and then ...
then the dinosaurs being social act out their socialness and they get together and they conspire
and of course that 's what makes steven spielberg 's movie conspiring dinosaurs chasing people around
so i assume everybody knows that if you actually had a piece of amber and it had an insect in it and you drilled into it and you got something out of that insect and you cloned it and you did it over and over and over again you 'd have a room full of mosquitos
and probably a whole bunch of trees as well
now if you want dinosaur dna i say go to the dinosaur
so that 's what we 've done
back in 1993 when the movie came out we actually had a grant from the national science foundation to attempt to extract dna from a dinosaur and we chose the dinosaur on the left a tyrannosaurus rex which was a very nice specimen
and one of my former doctoral students dr. mary schweitzer actually had the background to do this sort of thing
and so she looked into the bone of this t. rex one of the thigh bones and she actually found some very interesting structures in there
they found these red circular-looking objects and they looked for all the world like red blood cells
and they 're in what appear to be the blood channels that go through the bone
and so she thought well what the heck
so she sampled some material out of it
now it wasn 't dna she didn 't find dna
but she did find heme which is the biological foundation of hemoglobin
and that was really cool
that was interesting
that was here we have 65-million-year-old heme
well we tried and tried and we couldn 't really get anything else out of it
so a few years went by and then we started the hell creek project
and the hell creek project was this massive undertaking to get as many dinosaurs as we could possibly find and hopefully find some dinosaurs that had more material in them
and out in eastern montana there 's a lot of space a lot of badlands and not very many people and so you can go out there and find a lot of stuff
and we did find a lot of stuff
we found a lot of tyrannosaurs but we found one special tyrannosaur and we called it b-rex
and b-rex was found under a thousand cubic yards of rock
it wasn 't a very complete t. rex and it wasn 't a very big t. rex but it was a very special b-rex
and i and my colleagues cut into it and we were able to determine by looking at lines of arrested growth some lines in it that b-rex had died at the age of 16
we don 't really know how long dinosaurs lived because we haven 't found the oldest one yet
but this one died at the age of 16
we gave samples to mary schweitzer and she was actually able to determine that b-rex was a female based on medullary tissue found on the inside of the bone
medullary tissue is the calcium build-up the calcium storage basically when an animal is pregnant when a bird is pregnant
so here was the character that linked birds and dinosaurs
but mary went further
she took the bone and she dumped it into acid
now we all know that bones are fossilized and so if you dump it into acid there shouldn 't be anything left
but there was something left
there were blood vessels left
there were flexible clear blood vessels
and so here was the first soft tissue from a dinosaur
it was extraordinary
but she also found osteocytes which are the cells that laid down the bones
and try and try we could not find dna but she did find evidence of proteins
but we thought maybe well we thought maybe that the material was breaking down after it was coming out of the ground
we thought maybe it was deteriorating very fast
and so we built a laboratory in the back of an 18-wheeler trailer and actually took the laboratory to the field where we could get better samples
and we did we got better material
the cells looked better
the vessels looked better
found the protein collagen
i mean it was wonderful stuff
but it 's not dinosaur dna
so we have discovered that dinosaur dna and all dna just breaks down too fast
we 're just not going to be able to do what they did in jurassic park
we 're not going to be able to make a dinosaur based on a dinosaur
but birds are dinosaurs
birds are living dinosaurs
we actually classify them as dinosaurs
we now call them non-avian dinosaurs and avian dinosaurs
so the non-avian dinosaurs are the big clunky ones that went extinct
avian dinosaurs are our modern birds
so we don 't have to make a dinosaur because we already have them
i know you 're as bad as the sixth-graders
the sixth-graders look at it and they say no
you can call it a dinosaur but look at the velociraptor the velociraptor is cool
the chicken is not
so this is our problem as you can imagine
the chicken is a dinosaur
i mean it really is
you can 't argue with it because we 're the classifiers and we 've classified it that way
but the sixth-graders demand it
fix the chicken
so that 's what i 'm here to tell you about how we are going to fix a chicken
so we have a number of ways that we actually can fix the chicken
because evolution works we actually have some evolutionary tools
we 'll call them biological modification tools
we have selection
and we know selection works
we started out with a wolf-like creature and we ended up with a maltese
i mean that 's that 's definitely genetic modification
or any of the other funny-looking little dogs
we also have transgenesis
transgenesis is really cool too
that 's where you take a gene out of one animal and stick it in another one
that 's how people make glofish
you take a glow gene out of a coral or a jellyfish and you stick it in a zebrafish and puff they glow
and that 's pretty cool
and they obviously make a lot of money off of them
and now they 're making glow-rabbits and glow-all-sorts-of-things
i guess we could make a glow chicken
but i don 't think that 'll satisfy the sixth-graders either
but there 's another thing
there 's what we call atavism activation
and atavism activation is basically an atavism is an ancestral characteristic
you heard that occasionally children are born with tails and it 's because it 's an ancestral characteristic
and so there are a number of atavisms that can happen
snakes are occasionally born with legs
and here 's an example
this is a chicken with teeth
a fellow by the name of matthew harris at the university of wisconsin in madison actually figured out a way to stimulate the gene for teeth and so was able to actually turn the tooth gene on and produce teeth in chickens
now that 's a good characteristic
we can save that one
we know we can use that
we can make a chicken with teeth
that 's getting closer
that 's better than a glowing chicken
a friend of mine a colleague of mine dr. hans larsson at mcgill university is actually looking at atavisms
and he 's looking at them by looking at the embryo genesis of birds and actually looking at how they develop and he 's interested in how birds actually lost their tail
he 's also interested in the transformation of the arm the hand to the wing
he 's looking for those genes as well
and i said well if you can find those i can just reverse them and make what i need to make for the sixth-graders
and so he agreed
and so that 's what we 're looking into
if you look at dinosaur hands a velociraptor has that cool-looking hand with the claws on it
archaeopteryx which is a bird a primitive bird still has that very primitive hand
but as you can see the pigeon or a chicken or anything else another bird has kind of a weird-looking hand because the hand is a wing
but the cool thing is that if you look in the embryo as the embryo is developing the hand actually looks pretty much like the archaeopteryx hand
it has the three fingers the three digits
but a gene turns on that actually fuses those together
and so what we 're looking for is that gene
we want to stop that gene from turning on fusing those hands together so we can get a chicken that hatches out with a three-fingered hand like the archaeopteryx
and the same goes for the tails
birds have basically rudimentary tails
and so we know that in embryo as the animal is developing it actually has a relatively long tail
but a gene turns on and resorbs the tail gets rid of it
so that 's the other gene we 're looking for
we want to stop that tail from resorbing
so what we 're trying to do really is take our chicken modify it and make the chickenosaurus
it 's a cooler-looking chicken
but it 's just the very basics
so that really is what we 're doing
and people always say why do that
why make this thing
what good is it
well that 's a good question
actually i think it 's a great way to teach kids about evolutionary biology and developmental biology and all sorts of things
and quite frankly i think if colonel sanders was to be careful how he worded it he could actually advertise an extra piece
anyway when our dino-chicken hatches it will be obviously the poster child or what you might call a poster chick for technology entertainment and design
thank you
marco tempest what i 'd like to show you today is something in the way of an experiment
today 's its debut
it 's a demonstration of augmented reality
and the visuals you 're about to see are not prerecorded
they are live and reacting to me in real time
i like to think of it as a kind of technological magic
so fingers crossed
and keep your eyes on the big screen
augmented reality is the melding of the real world with computer-generated imagery
it seems the perfect medium to investigate magic and ask why in a technological age we continue to have this magical sense of wonder
magic is deception but it is a deception we enjoy
to enjoy being deceived an audience must first suspend its disbelief
it was the poet samuel taylor coleridge who first suggested this receptive state of mind
samuel taylor coleridge i try to convey a semblance of truth in my writing to produce for these shadows of the imagination a willing suspension of disbelief that for a moment constitutes poetic faith
mt this faith in the fictional is essential for any kind of theatrical experience
without it a script is just words
augmented reality is just the latest technology
and sleight of hand is just an artful demonstration of dexterity
we are all very good at suspending our disbelief
we do it every day while reading novels watching television or going to the movies
we willingly enter fictional worlds where we cheer our heroes and cry for friends we never had
without this ability there is no magic
it was jean robert-houdin france 's greatest illusionist who first recognized the role of the magician as a storyteller
he said something that i 've posted on the wall of my studio
jean robert-houdin a conjurer is not a juggler
he is an actor playing the part of a magician
mt which means magic is theater and every trick is a story
the tricks of magic follow the archetypes of narrative fiction
there are tales of creation and loss death and resurrection and obstacles that must be overcome
now many of them are intensely dramatic
magicians play with fire and steel defy the fury of the buzzsaw dare to catch a bullet or attempt a deadly escape
but audiences don 't come to see the magician die they come to see him live
because the best stories always have a happy ending
the tricks of magic have one special element
they are stories with a twist
now edward de bono argued that our brains are pattern matching machines
he said that magicians deliberately exploit the way their audiences think
edward de bono stage magic relies almost wholly on the momentum error
the audience is led to make assumptions or elaborations that are perfectly reasonable but do not in fact match what is being done in front of them
mt in that respect magic tricks are like jokes
jokes lead us down a path to an expected destination
but when the scenario we have imagined suddenly flips into something entirely unexpected we laugh
the same thing happens when people watch magic tricks
the finale defies logic gives new insight into the problem and audiences express their amazement with laughter
it 's fun to be fooled
one of the key qualities of all stories is that they 're made to be shared
we feel compelled to tell them
when i do a trick at a party that person will immediately pull their friend over and ask me to do it again
they want to share the experience
that makes my job more difficult because if i want to surprise them i need to tell a story that starts the same but ends differently a trick with a twist on a twist
it keeps me busy
now experts believe that stories go beyond our capacity for keeping us entertained
we think in narrative structures
we connect events and emotions and instinctively transform them into a sequence that can be easily understood
it 's a uniquely human achievement
we all want to share our stories whether it is the trick we saw at the party the bad day at the office or the beautiful sunset we saw on vacation
today thanks to technology we can share those stories as never before by email facebook blogs tweets on ted.com.
the tools of social networking these are the digital campfires around which the audience gathers to hear our story
we turn facts into similes and metaphors and even fantasies
we polish the rough edges of our lives so that they feel whole
our stories make us the people we are and sometimes the people we want to be
they give us our identity and a sense of community
and if the story is a good one it might even make us smile
thank you
thank you

hi
i did that for two reasons
first of all i wanted to give you a good visual first impression
but the main reason i did it is that that 's what happens to me when i 'm forced to wear a lady gaga skanky mic
i 'm used to a stationary mic
it 's the sensible shoe of public address
but you clamp this thing on my head and something happens
i just become skanky
so i 'm sorry about that
and i 'm already off-message
ladies and gentlemen i have devoted the past 25 years of my life to designing books
yes books you know the bound volumes with ink on paper
you cannot turn them off with a switch
tell your kids it all sort of started as a benign mistake like penicillin
what i really wanted was to be a graphic designer at one of the big design firms in new york city
but upon arrival there in the fall of 1986 and doing a lot of interviews i found that the only thing i was offered was to be assistant to the art director at alfred a. knopf a book publisher
now i was stupid but not so stupid that i turned it down
i had absolutely no idea what i was about to become part of and i was incredibly lucky
soon it had occurred to me what my job was
my job was to ask this question what do the stories look like
because that is what knopf is
it is the story factory one of the very best in the world
we bring stories to the public
the stories can be anything and some of them are actually true
but they all have one thing in common they all need to look like something
they all need a face
why to give you a first impression of what you are about to get into
a book designer gives form to content but also manages a very careful balance between the two
now the first day of my graphic design training at penn state university the teacher lanny sommese came into the room and he drew a picture of an apple on the blackboard and wrote the word apple underneath and he said ok lesson one listen up
and he covered up the picture and he said you either say this and then he covered up the word or you show this
but you don 't do this
because this is treating your audience like a moron
and they deserve better
and lo and behold soon enough i was able to put this theory to the test on two books that i was working on for knopf
the first was katharine hepburn 's memoirs and the second was a biography of marlene dietrich
now the hepburn book was written in a very conversational style it was like she was sitting across a table telling it all to you
the dietrich book was an observation by her daughter it was a biography
so the hepburn story is words and the dietrich story is pictures and so we did this
so there you are
pure content and pure form side by side
no fighting ladies
now what is the story here
someone is re-engineering dinosaurs by extracting their dna from prehistoric amber
genius
now luckily for me i live and work in new york city where there are plenty of dinosaurs
so i went to the museum of natural history and i checked out the bones and i went to the gift shop and i bought a book
and i was particularly taken with this page of the book and more specifically the lower right-hand corner
now i took this diagram and i put it in a photostat machine and i took a piece of tracing paper and i taped it over the photostat with a piece of scotch tape stop me if i 'm going too fast and then i took a rapidograph pen explain it to the youngsters and i just started to reconstitute the dinosaur
i had no idea what i was doing i had no idea where i was going but at some point i stopped when to keep going would seem like i was going too far
and what i ended up with was a graphic representation of us seeing this animal coming into being
we 're in the middle of the process
and then i just threw some typography on it
very basic stuff slightly suggestive of public park signage
everybody in house loved it and so off it goes to the author
and even back then michael was on the cutting edge
that was a relief to see that pour out of the machine
i miss michael
and sure enough somebody from mca universal calls our legal department to see if they can maybe look into buying the rights to the image just in case they might want to use it
well they used it
and i was thrilled
we all know it was an amazing movie and it was so interesting to see it go out into the culture and become this phenomenon and to see all the different permutations of it
but not too long ago i came upon this on the web
no that is not me
but whoever it is i can 't help but thinking they woke up one day like oh my god that wasn 't there last night ooooohh
i was so wasted
but if you think about it from my head to my hands to his leg
that 's a responsibility
and it 's a responsibility that i don 't take lightly
the book designer 's responsibility is threefold to the reader to the publisher and most of all to the author
i want you to look at the author 's book and say wow i need to read that
david sedaris is one of my favorite writers and the title essay in this collection is about his trip to a nudist colony
and the reason he went is because he had a fear of his body image and he wanted to explore what was underlying that
for me it was simply an excuse to design a book that you could literally take the pants off of
but when you do you don 't get what you expect
you get something that goes much deeper than that
and david especially loved this design because at book signings which he does a lot of he could take a magic marker and do this
hello
augusten burroughs wrote a memoir called [ dry ] and it 's about his time in rehab
in his 20s he was a hotshot ad executive and as mad men has told us a raging alcoholic
he did not think so however but his coworkers did an intervention and they said you are going to rehab or you will be fired and you will die
now to me this was always going to be a typographic solution what i would call the opposite of type 101
what does that mean
usually on the first day of introduction to typography you get the assignment of select a word and make it look like what it says it is so that 's type 101 right
very simple stuff
this is going to be the opposite of that
i want this book to look like it 's lying to you desperately and hopelessly the way an alcoholic would
the answer was the most low-tech thing you can imagine
i set up the type i printed it out on an epson printer with water-soluble ink taped it to the wall and threw a bucket of water at it presto
then when we went to press the printer put a spot gloss on the ink and it really looked like it was running
not long after it came out augusten was waylaid in an airport and he was hiding out in the bookstore spying on who was buying his books
and this woman came up to it and she squinted and she took it to the register and she said to the man behind the counter this one 's ruined
and the guy behind the counter said i know lady they all came in that way
now that 's a good printing job
a book cover is a distillation
it is a haiku if you will of the story
this particular story by osama tezuka is his epic life of the buddha and it 's eight volumes in all but the best thing is when it 's on your shelf you get a shelf life of the buddha moving from one age to the next
all of these solutions derive their origins from the text of the book but once the book designer has read the text then he has to be an interpreter and a translator
this story was a real puzzle
this is what it 's about
all right so i got a collection of the paintings together and i looked at them and i deconstructed them and i put them back together
and so here 's the design right
and so here 's the front and the spine and it 's flat
but the real story starts when you wrap it around a book and put it on the shelf
ahh we come upon them the clandestine lovers let 's draw them out
huhh they 've been discovered by the sultan
he will not be pleased
huhh and now the sultan is in danger
and now we have to open it up to find out what 's going to happen next
try experiencing that on a kindle
don 't get me started
seriously
much is to be gained by ebooks ease convenience portability
but something is definitely lost tradition a sensual experience the comfort of thingy-ness a little bit of humanity
do you know what john updike used to do the first thing when he would get a copy of one of his new books from alfred a. knopf
he 'd smell it
then he 'd run his hand over the rag paper and the pungent ink and the deckled edges of the pages
all those years all those books he never got tired of it
now i am all for the ipad but trust me smelling it will get you nowhere
now the apple guys are texting develop odor emission plug-in
and the last story i 'm going to talk about is quite a story
a woman named aomame in 1984 japan finds herself negotiating down a spiral staircase off an elevated highway when she gets to the bottom she can 't help but feel that all of a sudden she 's entered a new reality that 's just slightly different from the one that she left but very similar but different
and so we 're talking about parallel planes of existence sort of like a book jacket and the book that it covers
so how do we show this
we go back to hepburn and dietrich but now we merge them
so we 're talking about different planes different pieces of paper
so this is on a semi-transparent piece of velum
it 's one part of the form and content
when it 's on top of the paper board which is the opposite it forms this
so even if you don 't know anything about this book you are forced to consider a single person straddling two planes of existence
and the object itself invited exploration interaction consideration and touch
this debuted at number two on the new york times best seller list
this is unheard of both for us the publisher and the author
we 're talking a 900-page book that is as weird as it is compelling and featuring a climactic scene in which a horde of tiny people emerge from the mouth of a sleeping girl and cause a german shepherd to explode
not exactly jackie collins
fourteen weeks on the best seller list eight printings and still going strong
so even though we love publishing as an art we very much know it 's a business too and that if we do our jobs right and get a little lucky that great art can be great business
so that 's my story to be continued
what does it look like
yes it can it does and it will but for this book designer page-turner dog-eared place-holder notes in the margins-taker ink-sniffer the story looks like this
thank you
hi everyone i 'm sirena
i 'm 11 years old and from connecticut
well i 'm not really sure why i 'm here
i mean what does this have to do with technology entertainment and design
well i count my ipod cellphone and computer as technology but this has nothing to do with that
so i did a little research on it
well this is what i found
of course i hope i can memorize it
the violin is basically made of a wood box and four main strings
by playing the string the string vibrates and produces a sound wave
sound passes through a piece of wood called a bridge and goes down to the wood box and gets amplified but ... let me think
okay on the other hand by placing your finger in a different position on the fingerboard it changes the string length that changes the frequency of the sound wave
oh my gosh
okay this is sort of a technology but i can call it a 16th-century technology
but actually the most fascinating thing that i found was that even the audio system or wave transmission nowadays are still basically based on the same principle of producing and projecting sound
isn 't that cool
design i love its design
i remember when i was little my mom asked me would you like to play the violin or the piano
i looked at that giant monster and said to myself i am not going to lock myself on that bench the whole day
this is small and lightweight
i can play from standing sitting or walking
and you know what
the best of all is that if i don 't want to practice i can hide it
the violin is very beautiful
some people relate it as the shape of a lady but whether you like it or not it 's been so for more than 400 years unlike modern stuff that easily looks dated
but i think it 's very personal and unique that although each violin looks pretty similar that no two violins sound the same
even from the same maker or based on the same model
entertainment i love the entertainment but actually the instrument itself isn 't very entertaining
i mean when i first got my violin and tried to play around it was actually really bad because it didn 't sound like the way i 'd heard from other kids so horrible and so scratchy so it wasn 't entertaining at all
but besides my brother found this very funny
yuk yuk yuk
a few years later i heard a joke about the greatest violinist jascha heifetz
after mr. heifetz 's concert a lady came over and complimented oh mr. heifetz your violin sounded so great tonight
and mr. heifetz was a very cool person so he picked up his violin and said funny i don 't hear anything
and now i realize that as the musician we human beings we have a great mind artistic heart and skill that can change the 16th-century technology and a legendary design to a wonderful entertainment
now i know why i 'm here
at first i thought i was just going to be here to perform but unexpectedly i learned and enjoyed much more
but ... although some of them were quite up there for me
like the multi-dimension stuff
i mean honestly i 'd be happy enough if i can actually get my two dimension correct in school
but actually the most impressive thing to me is that ... well actually i would also like to stand this for all children is to say thank you to all adults for actually caring for us a lot and to make our future world much better
thank you

phyllis rodriguez we are here today because of the fact that we have what most people consider an unusual friendship
and it is
and yet it feels natural to us now
i first learned that my son had been in the world trade center on the morning of september 11th 2001
we didn 't know if he had perished yet until 36 hours later
at the time we knew that it was political
we were afraid of what our country was going to do in the name of our son my husband orlando and i and our family
and when i saw it and yet through the shock the terrible shock and the terrible explosion in our lives literally we were not vengeful
and a couple of weeks later when zacarias moussaoui was indicted on six counts of conspiracy to commit terrorism and the u.s. government called for a death penalty for him if convicted my husband and i spoke out in opposition to that publicly
through that and through human rights groups we were brought together with several other victims families
when i saw aicha in the media coming over when her son was indicted and i thought what a brave woman
someday i want to meet that woman when i 'm stronger
i was still in deep grief i knew i didn 't have the strength
i knew i would find her someday or we would find each other
because when people heard that my son was a victim i got immediate sympathy
but when people learned what her son was accused of she didn 't get that sympathy
but her suffering is equal to mine
so we met in november 2002 and aicha will now tell you how that came about
aicha el-wafi good afternoon ladies and gentlemen
i am the mother of zacarias moussaoui
and i asked the organization of human rights to put me in touch with the parents of the victims
so they introduced me to five families
and i saw phyllis and i watched her
she was the only mother in the group
the others were brothers sisters
and i saw in her eyes that she was a mother just like me
i suffered a lot as a mother
i was married when i was 14
i lost a child when i was 15 a second child when i was 16
so the story with zacarias was too much really
and i still suffer because my son is like he 's buried alive
i know she really cried for her son
but she knows where he is
my son i don 't know where he is
i don 't know if he 's alive i don 't know if he 's tortured
i don 't know what happened to him
so that 's why i decided to tell my story so that my suffering is something positive for other women
for all the women all the mothers that give life you can give back you can change
it 's up to us women because we are women because we love our children
we must be hand-in-hand and do something together
it 's not against women it 's for us for us women for our children
i talk against violence against terrorism
i go to schools to talk to young muslim girls so they don 't accept to be married against their will very young
so if i can save one of the young girls and avoid that they get married and suffer as much as i did well this is something good
this is why i 'm here in front of you
pr i would like to say that i have learned so much from aicha starting with that day we had our very first meeting with other family members which was a very private meeting with security because it was november 2002 and frankly we were afraid of the super-patriotism of that time in the country those of us family members
but we were all so nervous
why does she want to meet us
and then she was nervous
why did we want to meet her
what did we want from each other
before we knew each others names or anything we had embraced and wept
then we sat in a circle with support with help from people experienced in this kind of reconciliation
and aicha started and she said i don 't know if my son is guilty or innocent but i want to tell you how sorry i am for what happened to your families
i know what it is to suffer and i feel that if there is a crime a person should be tried fairly and punished
but she reached out to us in that way and it was i 'd like to say it was an ice-breaker
and what happened then is we all told our stories and we all connected as human beings
by the end of the afternoon it was about three hours after lunch we 'd felt as if we 'd known each other forever
now what i learned from her is a woman not only who could be so generous under these present circumstances and what it was then and what was being done to her son but the life she 's had
i never had met someone with such a hard life from such a totally different culture and environment from my own
and i feel that we have a special connection which i value very much
and i think it 's all about being afraid of the other but making that step and then realizing hey this wasn 't so hard
who else can i meet that i don 't know or that i 'm so different from
so aicha do you have a couple of words for conclusion
because our time is up
aw i wanted to say that we have to try to know other people the other
you have to be generous and your hearts must be generous your mind must be generous
you must be tolerant
you have to fight against violence
and i hope that someday we 'll all live together in peace and respecting each other
this is what i wanted to say
about a year ago i asked myself a question knowing what i know why am i not a vegetarian
after all i 'm one of the green guys i grew up with hippie parents in a log cabin
i started a site called treehugger i care about this stuff
i knew that eating a mere hamburger a day can increase my risk of dying by a third
cruelty i knew that the 10 billion animals we raise each year for meat are raised in factory farm conditions that we hypocritically wouldn 't even consider for our own cats dogs and other pets
environmentally meat amazingly causes more emissions than all of transportation combined cars trains planes buses boats all of it
and beef production uses 100 times the water that most vegetables do
i also knew that i 'm not alone
we as a society are eating twice as much meat as we did in the 50s
so what was once the special little side treat now is the main much more regular
so really any of these angles should have been enough to convince me to go vegetarian
yet there i was chk chk chk tucking into a big old steak
so why was i stalling
i realized that what i was being pitched was a binary solution
it was either you 're a meat eater or you 're a vegetarian and i guess i just wasn 't quite ready
imagine your last hamburger
so my common sense my good intentions were in conflict with my taste buds
and i 'd commit to doing it later and not surprisingly later never came
sound familiar
so i wondered might there be a third solution
and i thought about it and i came up with one
i 've been doing it for the last year and it 's great
it 's called weekday veg
the name says it all nothing with a face monday through friday
on the weekend your choice
simple
if you want to take it to the next level remember the major culprits in terms of environmental damage and health are red and processed meats
so you want to swap those out with some good sustainably harvested fish
it 's structured so it ends up being simple to remember and it 's okay to break it here and there
after all cutting five days a week is cutting 70 percent of your meat intake
the program has been great weekday veg
my footprint 's smaller i 'm lessening pollution i feel better about the animals i 'm even saving money
best of all i 'm healthier i know that i 'm going to live longer and i 've even lost a little weight
so please ask yourselves for your health for your pocketbook for the environment for the animals what 's stopping you from giving weekday veg a shot
after all if all of us ate half as much meat it would be like half of us were vegetarians
thank you
i 'm going to start with a little story
so i grew up in this neighborhood when i was 15 years old i went from being what i think was a strapping young athlete over four months slowly wasting away until i was basically a famine victim with an unquenchable thirst
i had basically digested away my body
and this all came to a head when i was on a backpacking trip my first one ever actually on old rag mountain in west virginia and was putting my face into puddles of water and drinking like a dog
that night i was taken into the emergency room and diagnosed as a type 1 diabetic in full-blown ketoacidosis
and i recovered thanks to the miracles of modern medicine insulin and other things and gained all my weight back and more
and something festered inside me after this happened
what i thought about was what caused the diabetes
you see diabetes is an autoimmune disease where your body fights itself and at the time people thought that somehow maybe exposure to a pathogen had triggered my immune system to fight the pathogen and then kill the cells that make insulin
and this is what i thought for a long period of time and that 's in fact what medicine and people have focused on quite a bit the microbes that do bad things
and that 's where i need my assistant here now
you may recognize her
so i went yesterday i apologize i skipped a few of the talks and i went over to the national academy of sciences building and they sell toys giant microbes
and here we go
so you have caught flesh-eating disease if you caught that one
i gotta get back out my baseball ability here
so unfortunately or not surprisingly most of the microbes they sell at the national academy building are pathogens
everybody focuses on the things that kill us and that 's what i was focusing on
and it turns out that we are covered in a cloud of microbes and those microbes actually do us good much of the time rather than killing us
and so we 've known about this for some period of time
people have used microscopes to look at the microbes that cover us i know you 're not paying attention to me but ...
the microbes that cover us
and if you look at them in the microscope you can see that we actually have 10 times as many cells of microbes on us as we have human cells
there 's more mass in the microbes than the mass of our brain
we are literally a teeming ecosystem of microorganisms
and unfortunately if you want to learn about the microorganisms just looking at them in a microscope is not sufficient
and so we just heard about the dna sequencing
it turns out that one of the best ways to look at microbes and to understand them is to look at their dna
and that 's what i 've been doing for 20 years using dna sequencing collecting samples from various places including the human body reading the dna sequence and then using that dna sequencing to tell us about the microbes that are in a particular place
and what 's amazing when you use this technology for example looking at humans we 're not just covered in a sea of microbes
there are thousands upon thousands of different kinds of microbes on us
we have millions of genes of microbes in our human microbiome covering us
and so this microbial diversity differs between people and what people have been thinking about in the last 10 maybe 15 years is maybe these microbes this microbial cloud in and on us and the variation between us may be responsible for some of the health and illness differences between us
and that comes back to the diabetes story i was telling you
it turns out that people now think that one of the triggers for type 1 diabetes is not fighting a pathogen but is in fact trying to miscommunicating with the microbes that live in and on you
and somehow maybe the microbial community that 's in and on me got off and then this triggered some sort of immune response and led to me killing the cells that make insulin in my body
and so what i want to tell you about for a few minutes is what people have learned using dna sequencing techniques in particular to study the microbial cloud that lives in and on us
and i want to tell you a story about a personal project
my first personal experience with studying the microbes on the human body actually came from a talk that i gave right around the corner from here at georgetown
i gave a talk and a family friend who happened to be the dean of georgetown medical school was at the talk and came up to me afterwards saying they were doing a study of ileal transplants in people
and they wanted to look at the microbes after the transplants
and so i started a collaboration with this person michael zasloff and thomas fishbein to look at the microbes that colonized these ilea after they were transplanted into a recipient
and i can tell you all the details about the microbial study that we did there but the reason i want to tell you this story is something really striking that they did at the beginning of this project
they take the donor ileum which is filled with microbes from a donor and they have a recipient who might have a problem with their microbial community say crohn 's disease and they sterilized the donor ileum
cleaned out all the microbes and then put it in the recipient
they did this because this was common practice in medicine even though it was obvious that this was not a good idea
and fortunately in the course of this project the transplant surgeons and the other people decided forget common practice we have to switch
so they actually switched to leaving some of the microbial community in the ileum they leave the microbes with the donor and theoretically that might help the people who are receiving this ileal transplant
and so people this is a study that i did now
in the last few years there 's been a great expansion in using dna technology to study the microbes in and on people
there 's something called the human microbiome project that 's going on in the united states and metahit going on in europe and a lot of other projects
and when people have done a variety of studies they have learned things such as when a baby is born during vaginal delivery you get colonized by the microbes from your mother
there are risk factors associated with cesarean sections some of those risk factors may be due to mis-colonization when you carve a baby out of its mother rather than being delivered through the birth canal
and a variety of other studies have shown that the microbial community that lives in and on us helps in development of the immune system helps in fighting off pathogens helps in our metabolism and determining our metabolic rate probably determines our odor and may even shape our behavior in a variety of ways
and so these studies have documented or suggested out of a variety of important functions for the microbial community this cloud the non-pathogens that live in and on us
and one area that i think is very interesting which many of you may have now that we 've thrown microbes into the crowd is something that i would call germophobia
so people are really into cleanliness right
we have antibiotics in our kitchen counters people are washing every part of them all of the time we pump antibiotics into our food into our communities we take antibiotics excessively
and killing pathogens is a good thing if you 're sick but we should understand that when we pump chemicals and antibiotics into our world that we 're also killing the cloud of microbes that live in and on us
and excessive use of antibiotics in particular in children has been shown to be associated with again risk factors for obesity for autoimmune diseases for a variety of problems that are probably due to disruption of the microbial community
so the microbial community can go wrong whether we want it to or not or we can kill it with antibiotics but what can we do to restore it
i 'm sure many people here have heard about probiotics
probiotics are one thing that you can try and do to restore the microbial community that is in and on you
and they definitely have been shown to be effective in some cases
there 's a project going on at uc davis where people are using probiotics to try and treat prevent necrotizing enterocolitis in premature infants
premature infants have real problems with their microbial community
and it may be that probiotics can help prevent the development of this horrible necrotizing enterocolitis in these premature infants
but probiotics are sort of a very very simple solution
most of the pills that you can take or the yogurts that you can eat have one or two species in them maybe five species in them and the human community is thousands upon thousands of species
so what can we do to restore our microbial community when we have thousands and thousands of species on us
well one thing that animals seem to do is they eat poo coprophagia
and it turns out that many veterinarians old school veterinarians in particular have been doing something called poo tea not booty but poo tea to treat colic and other ailments in horses and cows and things like that where you make tea from the poo from a healthy individual animal and you feed it to a sick animal
although unless you have a fistulated cow with a big hole in its side and you can put your hand into its rumen it 's hard to imagine that the delivery of microbes directly into the mouth and through the entire top of the digestive tract is the best delivery system so you may have heard in people they are now doing fecal transplants where rather than delivering a couple of probiotic microbes through the mouth they are delivering a community of probiotics a community of microbes from a healthy donor through the other end
and this has turned out to be very effective in fighting certain intransigent infectious diseases like clostridium difficile infections that can stay with people for years and years and years
transplants of the feces of the microbes from the feces from a healthy donor has actually been shown to cure systemic c. dif infections in some people
now what these transplants these fecal transplants or the poo tea suggest to me and many other people have come up with this same idea is that the microbial community in and on us it 's an organ
we should view it as a functioning organ part of ourselves
we should treat it carefully and with respect and we do not want to mess with it say by c-sections or by antibiotics or excessive cleanliness without some real good justification
and what the dna sequencing technologies are allowing people to do now is do detailed studies of say 100 patients who have crohn 's disease and 100 people who don 't have crohn 's disease
or 100 people who took antibiotics when they were little and 100 people who did not take antibiotics
and we can now start to compare the community of microbes and their genes and see if there are differences
and eventually we may be able to understand if they 're not just correlative differences but causative
studies in model systems like mouse and other animals are also helping do this but people are now using these technologies because they 've gotten very cheap to study the microbes in and on a variety of people
so in wrapping up what i want to tell you about is i didn 't tell you a part of the story of coming down with diabetes
it turns out that my father was an m.d. actually studied hormones i told him many times that i was tired thirsty not feeling very good
and he shrugged it off i think he either thought i was just complaining a lot or it was the typical m.d. nothing can be wrong with my children
we even went to the international society of endocrinology meeting as family in quebec
and i was getting up every five minutes to pee and drinking everybody 's water at the table and i think they all thought i was a druggie
but the reason i 'm telling you this is that the medical community my father as an example sometimes doesn 't see what 's right in front of their eyes
the microbial cloud it is right in front of us
we can 't see it most of the time it 's invisible
they 're microbes they 're tiny
but we can see them through their dna we can see them through the effects that they have on people
and what we need now is to start thinking about this microbial community in the context of everything in human medicine
it doesn 't mean that it affects every part of us but it might
what we need is a full field guide to the microbes that live in and on people so that we can understand what they 're doing to our lives
we are them they are us
thank you
i 'd like to start tonight by something completely different asking you to join me by stepping off the land and jumping into the open ocean for a moment
90 percent of the living space on the planet is in the open ocean and it 's where life the title of our seminar tonight it 's where life began
and it 's a lively and a lovely place but we 're rapidly changing the oceans with our not only with our overfishing our irresponsible fishing our adding of pollutants like fertilizer from our cropland but also most recently with climate change and steve schneider i 'm sure will be going into greater detail on this
now as we continue to tinker with the oceans more and more reports are predicting that the kinds of seas that we 're creating will be conducive to low-energy type of animals like jellyfish and bacteria
and this might be the kind of seas we 're headed for
now jellyfish are strangely hypnotic and beautiful and you 'll see lots of gorgeous ones at the aquarium on friday but they sting like hell and jellyfish sushi and sashimi is just not going to fill you up
about 100 grams of jellyfish equals four calories
so it may be good for the waistline but it probably won 't keep you satiated for very long
and a sea that 's just filled and teeming with jellyfish isn 't very good for all the other creatures that live in the oceans that is unless you eat jellyfish
and this is this voracious predator launching a sneak attack on this poor little unsuspecting jellyfish there a by-the-wind sailor
and that predator is the giant ocean sunfish the mola mola whose primary prey are jellyfish
this animal is in the guinness world book of records for being the world 's heaviest bony fish
it reaches up to almost 5,000 pounds on a diet of jellyfish primarily
and i think it 's kind of a nice little cosmological convergence here that the mola mola its common name is sunfish that its favorite food is the moon jelly
so it 's kind of nice the sun and the moon getting together this way even if one is eating the other
now this is typically how you see sunfish this is where they get their common name
they like to sunbathe can 't blame them
they just lay out on the surface of the sea and most people think they 're sick or lazy but that 's a typical behavior they lie out and bask on the surface
their other name mola mola is it sounds hawaiian but it 's actually latin for millstone and that 's attributable to their roundish very bizarre cut-off shape
it 's as if as they were growing they just forgot the tail part
and that 's actually what drew me to the mola in the first place was this terribly bizarre shape
you know you look at sharks and they 're streamlined and they 're sleek and you look at tuna and they 're like torpedoes they just give away their agenda they 're about migration and strength and then you look at the sunfish
and this is just so elegantly mysterious it 's just it really kind of holds its cards a lot tighter than say a tuna
so i was just intrigued with what you know what is this animal 's story
well as with anything in biology nothing really makes sense except in the light of evolution
the mola 's no exception
they appeared shortly after the dinosaurs disappeared 65 million years ago at a time when whales still had legs and they come from a rebellious little puffer fish faction oblige me a little kipling-esque storytelling here
of course evolution is somewhat random and you know about 55 million years ago there was this rebellious little puffer fish faction that said oh the heck with the coral reefs we 're going to head to the high seas
and lots of generations lots of tweaking and torquing and we turn our puffer into the mola
you know if you give mother nature enough time that is what she will produce
they look maybe they look kind of prehistoric and unfinished abridged perhaps but in fact in fact they are the they vie for the top position of the most evolutionarily-derived fish in the sea right up there with flat fish
they 're every single thing about that fish has been changed
and in terms of fishes fishes appeared 500 million years ago and they 're pretty modern just 50 million years ago so so interestingly they give away their ancestry as they develop
they start as little eggs and they 're in the guinness world book of records again for having the most number of eggs of any vertebrate on the planet
a single four-foot female had 300 million eggs can carry 300 million eggs in her ovaries imagine and they get to be over 10 feet long imagine what a 10 foot one has
and from that little egg they pass through this spiky little porcupine fish stage reminiscent of their ancestry and develop this is their little adolescent stage
they school as adolescents and become behemoth loners as adults
that 's a little diver up there in the corner
they 're in the guinness world book of records again for being the vertebrate growth champion of the world
from their little hatching size of their egg into their little larval stage till they reach adulthood they put on 600 million times an increase in weight
600 million now imagine if you gave birth to a little baby and you had to feed this thing
that would mean that your child you would expect it to gain the weight of six titanics
now i don 't know how you 'd feed a child like that but we don 't know how fast the molas grow in the wild but captive growth studies at the monterey bay aquarium one of the first places to have them in captivity they had one that gained 800 lbs in 14 months
i said now that 's a true american
so being a loner is a great thing especially in today 's seas because schooling used to be salvation for fishes but it 's suicide for fishes now
but unfortunately molas even though they don 't school they still get caught in nets as by-catch
if we 're going to save the world from total jellyfish domination then we 've got to figure out what the jellyfish predators how they live their lives like the mola
and unfortunately they make up a large portion of the california by-catch up to 26 percent of the drift net
and in the mediterranean in the swordfish net fisheries they make up up to 90 percent
so we 've got to figure out how they 're living their lives
and how do you do that
how do you do that with an animal very few places in the world
this is an open ocean creature it knows no boundaries it doesn 't go to land
how do you get insight
how do you seduce an open ocean creature like that to spill its secrets
well there 's some great new technology that has just recently become available and it 's just a boon for getting insight into open ocean animals
and it 's pictured right here that little tag up there
that little tag can record temperature depth and light intensity which is correlated with time and from that we can get locations
and it can record this data for up to two years and keep it in that tag release at a pre-programmed time float to the surface upload all that data that whole travelogue to satellite which relays it directly to our computers and we 've got that whole dataset and we didn 't even have we just had to tag the animal and then we went home and you know sat at our desks
so the great thing about the mola is that when we put the tag on them if you look up here that 's streaming off that 's right where we put the tag
and it just so happens that 's a parasite hanging off the mola
molas are infamous for carrying tons of parasites
they 're just parasite hotels even their parasites have parasites
i think donne wrote a poem about that
but they have 40 genera of parasites and so we figured just one more parasite won 't be too much of a problem
and they happen to be a very good vehicle for carrying oceanographic equipment
they don 't seem to mind so far
so what are we trying to find out we 're focusing on the pacific
we 're tagging on the california coast and we 're tagging over in taiwan and japan
and we 're interested in how these animals are using the currents using temperature using the open ocean to live their lives
we 'd love to tag in monterey
monterey is one of the few places in the world where molas come in large numbers
not this time of year it 's more around october
and we 'd love to tag here this is an aerial shot of monterey but unfortunately the molas here end up looking like this because another one of our locals really likes molas but in the wrong way
the california sea lion takes the molas as soon as they come into the bay rips off their fins fashions them into the ultimate frisbee mola style and then tosses them back and forth
and i 'm not exaggerating it is just and sometimes they don 't eat them it 's just spiteful
and you know the locals think it 's terrible behavior it 's just horrible watching this happen day after day
the poor little molas coming in getting ripped to shreds so we head down south to san diego
not so many california sea lions down there
and the molas there you can find them with a spotter plane very easily and they like to hang out under floating rafts of kelp
and under those kelps this is why the molas come there because it 's spa time for the molas there
as soon as they get under those rafts of kelp the exfoliating cleaner fish come
and they come and give the molas you can see they strike this funny little position that says i 'm not threatening but i need a massage
and they 'll put their fins out and their eyes go in the back of their head and the fish come up and they just clean clean clean because the molas you know there 's just a smorgasbord of parasites
and it 's also a great place to go down south because the water 's warmer and the molas are kind of friendly down there
i mean what other kind of fish if you approach it right will say okay scratch me right there
you truly can swim up to a mola they 're very gentle and if you approach them right you can give them a scratch and they enjoy it
so we 've also tagged one part of the pacific we 've gone over to another part of the pacific and we 've tagged in taiwan and we tagged in japan
and over in these places the molas are caught in set nets that line these countries
and they 're not thrown back as by-catch they 're eaten
we were served a nine-course meal of mola after we tagged
well not the one we tagged
and everything from the kidney to the testes to the back bone to the fin muscle to i think that ís pretty much the whole fish is eaten
so the hardest part of tagging now is after you put that tag on you have to wait months
and you 're just wondering oh i hope the fish is safe i hope i hope it 's going to be able to actually live its life out during the course that the tag is recording
the tags cost 3500 dollars each and then satellite time is another 500 dollars so you 're like oh i hope the tag is okay
and so the waiting is really the hardest part
i 'm going to show you our latest dataset
and it hasn 't been published so it 's totally privy information just for ted
and in showing you this you know when we 're looking at this data we 're thinking oh do these animals do they cross the equator
do they go from one side of the pacific to the other
and we found that they kind of are homebodies
they 're not big migrators this is their track we deployed the tag off of tokyo and the mola in one month kind of got into the kuroshio current off of japan and foraged there
and after four months went up you know off of the north part of japan
and that 's kind of their home range
now that 's important though because if there 's a lot of fishing pressure that population doesn 't get replenished
so that 's a very important piece of data
but also what 's important is that they 're not slacker lazy fish
they 're super industrious
and this is a day in the life of a mola and if we they 're up and down and up and down and up and down and up and up and down up to 40 times a day
as the sun comes up you see in the blue they start their dive
down and as the sun gets brighter they go a little deeper little deeper
they plumb the depths down to 600 meters in temperatures to one degree centigrade and this is why you see them on the surface it 's so cold down there
they 've got to come up warm get that solar power and then plunge back into the depths and go up and down and up and down
and they 're hitting a layer down there it 's called the deep scattering layer which a whole variety of food 's in that layer
so rather than just being some sunbathing slacker they 're really very industrious fish that dance this wild dance between the surface and the bottom and through temperature
we see the same pattern now with these tags we 're seeing a similar pattern for swordfishes manta rays tunas a real three-dimensional play
this is part of a much larger program called the census of marine life where they 're going to be tagging all over the world and the mola 's going to enter into that
and what 's exciting you all travel and you know the best thing about traveling is to be able to find the locals and to find the great places by getting the local knowledge
well now with the census of marine life we 'll be able to sidle up to all the locals and explore 90 percent of our living space with local knowledge
it 's never it 's really never been a more exciting or a vital time to be a biologist
which brings me to my last point and what i think is kind of the most fun
i set up a website because i was getting so many questions about molas and sunfish
and so i just figured i 'd have the questions answered and i 'd be able to thank my funders like national geographic and lindbergh
but people would write into the site with all sorts of all sorts of stories about these animals and wanting to help me get samples for genetic analysis
and what i found most exciting is that everyone had a shared a shared love and an interest in the oceans
i was getting reports from catholic nuns jewish rabbis muslims christians everybody writing in united by their love of life
and to me that i don 't think i could say it any better than the immortal bard himself one touch of nature makes the whole world kin
and sure it may be just one big old silly fish but it 's helping
if it 's helping to unite the world i think it 's definitely the fish of the future
okay so 90 percent of my photographic process is in fact not photographic
it involves a campaign of letter writing research and phone calls to access my subjects which can range from hamas leaders in gaza to a hibernating black bear in its cave in west virginia
and oddly the most notable letter of rejection i ever received came from walt disney world a seemingly innocuous site
and it read i 'm just going to read a key sentence especially during these violent times i personally believe that the magical spell cast upon guests who visit our theme parks is particularly important to protect and helps to provide them with an important fantasy they can escape to
photography threatens fantasy
they didn 't want to let my camera in because it confronts constructed realities myths and beliefs and provides what appears to be evidence of a truth
but there are multiple truths attached to every image depending on the creator 's intention the viewer and the context in which it is presented
over a five year period following september 11th when the american media and government were seeking hidden and unknown sites beyond its borders most notably weapons of mass destruction i chose to look inward at that which was integral to america 's foundation mythology and daily functioning
i wanted to confront the boundaries of the citizen self-imposed and real and confront the divide between privileged and public access to knowledge
it was a critical moment in american history and global history where one felt they didn 't have access to accurate information
and i wanted to see the center with my own eyes but what i came away with is a photograph
and it 's just another place from which to observe and the understanding that there are no absolute all-knowing insiders
and the outsider can never really reach the core
i 'm going to run through some of the photographs in this series
it 's titled an american index of the hidden and unfamiliar and it 's comprised of nearly 70 images
in this context i 'll just show you a few
this is a nuclear waste storage and encapsulation facility at hanford site in washington state where there are over 1,900 stainless steel capsules containing nuclear waste submerged in water
a human standing in front of an unprotected capsule would die instantly
and i found one section amongst all of these that actually resembled the outline of the united states of america which you can see here
and a big part of the work that is sort of absent in this context is text
so i create these two poles
every image is accompanied with a very detailed factual text
and what i 'm most interested in is the invisible space between a text and its accompanying image and how the image is transformed by the text and the text by the image
so at best the image is meant to float away into abstraction and multiple truths and fantasy
and then the text functions as this cruel anchor that kind of nails it to the ground
but in this context i 'm just going to read an abridged version of those texts
this is a cryopreservation unit and it holds the bodies of the wife and mother of cryonics pioneer robert ettinger who hoped to be awoken one day to extended life in good health with advancements in science and technology all for the cost of 35 thousand dollars for forever
this is a 21-year-old palestinian woman undergoing hymenoplasty
hymenoplasty is a surgical procedure which restores the virginal state allowing her to adhere to certain cultural expectations regarding virginity and marriage
so it essentially reconstructs a ruptured hymen allowing her to bleed upon having sexual intercourse to simulate the loss of virginity
this is a jury simulation deliberation room and you can see beyond that two-way mirror jury advisers standing in a room behind the mirror
and they observe deliberations after mock trial proceedings so that they can better advise their clients how to adjust their trial strategy to have the outcome that they 're hoping for
this process costs 60,000 dollars
this is a u.s. customs and border protection room a contraband room at john f. kennedy international airport
on that table you can see 48 hours worth of seized goods from passengers entering in to the united states
there is a pig 's head and african cane rats
and part of my photographic work is i 'm not just documenting what 's there
i do take certain liberties and intervene
and in this i really wanted it to resemble an early still-life painting so i spent some time with the smells and items
this is the exhibited art on the walls of the cia in langley virginia their original headquarters building
and the cia has had a long history with both covert and public cultural diplomacy efforts
and it 's speculated that some of their interest in the arts was designed to counter soviet communism and promote what it considered to be pro-american thoughts and aesthetics
and one of the art forms that elicited the interest of the agency and had thus come under question is abstract expressionism
this is the forensic anthropology research facility and on a six acre plot there are approximately 75 cadavers at any given time that are being studied by forensic anthropologists and researchers who are interested in monitoring a rate of corpse decomposition
and in this particular photograph the body of a young boy has been used to reenact a crime scene
this is the only federally funded site where it is legal to cultivate cannabis for scientific research in the united states
it 's a research crop marijuana grow room
and part of the work that i hope for is that there is a sort of disorienting entropy where you can 't find any discernible formula in how these things they sort of awkwardly jump from government to science to religion to security and you can 't completely understand how information is being distributed
these are transatlantic submarine communication cables that travel across the floor of the atlantic ocean connecting north america to europe
they carry over 60 million simultaneous voice conversations and in a lot of the government and technology sites there was just this very apparent vulnerability
this one is almost humorous because it feels like i could just snip all of that conversation in one easy cut
but stuff did feel like it could have been taken 30 or 40 years ago like it was locked in the cold war era and hadn 't necessarily progressed
this is a braille edition of playboy magazine
and this is ... a division of the library of congress produces a free national library service for the blind and visually impaired and the publications they choose to publish are based on reader popularity
and playboy is always in the top few
but you 'd be surprised they don 't do the photographs it 's just the text
this is an avian quarantine facility where all imported birds coming into america are required to undergo a 30-day quarantine where they are tested for diseases including exotic newcastle disease and avian influenza
this film shows the testing of a new explosive fill on a warhead
and the air armament center at eglin air force base in florida is responsible for the deployment and testing of all air-delivered weaponry coming from the united states
and the film was shot on 72 millimeter government-issue film
and that red dot is a marking on the government-issue film
all living white tigers in north america are the result of selective inbreeding that would be mother to son father to daughter sister to brother to allow for the genetic conditions that create a salable white tiger
meaning white fur ice blue eyes a pink nose
and the majority of these white tigers are not born in a salable state and are killed at birth
it 's a very violent process that is little known
and the white tiger is obviously celebrated in several forms of entertainment
kenny was born he actually made it to adulthood
he has since passed away but was mentally retarded and suffers from severe bone abnormalities
this on a lighter note is at george lucas personal archive
this is the death star
and it 's shown here in its true orientation
in the context of star wars return of the jedi its mirror image is presented
they flip the negative
and you can see the photoetched brass detailing and the painted acrylic facade
in the context of the film this is a deep-space battle station of the galactic empire capable of annihilating planets and civilizations and in reality it measures about four feet by two feet
this is at fort campbell in kentucky
it 's a military operations on urbanized terrain site
essentially they 've simulated a city for urban combat and this is one of the structures that exists in that city
it 's called the world church of god
it 's supposed to be a generic site of worship
and after i took this photograph they constructed a wall around the world church of god to mimic the set-up of mosques in afghanistan or iraq
and i worked with mehta vihar who creates virtual simulations for the army for tactical practice
and we put that wall around the world church of god and also used the characters and vehicles and explosions that are offered in the video games for the army
and i put them into my photograph
this is live hiv virus at harvard medical school who is working with the u.s. government to develop sterilizing immunity
and alhurra is a u.s. government- sponsored arabic language television network that distributes news and information to over 22 countries in the arab world
it runs 24 hours a day commercial free
however it 's illegal to broadcast alhurra within the united states
and in 2004 they developed a channel called alhurra iraq which specifically deals with events occurring in iraq and is broadcast to iraq
now i 'm going to move on to another project i did
it 's titled the innocents
and for the men in these photographs photography had been used to create a fantasy
contradicting its function as evidence of a truth in these instances it furthered the fabrication of a lie
i traveled across the united states photographing men and women who had been wrongfully convicted of crimes they did not commit violent crimes
i investigate photography 's ability to blur truth and fiction and its influence on memory which can lead to severe even lethal consequences
for the men in these photographs the primary cause of their wrongful conviction was mistaken identification
a victim or eyewitness identifies a suspected perpetrator through law enforcement 's use of images
but through exposure to composite sketches polaroids mug shots and line-ups eyewitness testimony can change
i 'll give you an example from a case
a woman was raped and presented with a series of photographs from which to identify her attacker
she saw some similarities in one of the photographs but couldn 't quite make a positive identification
days later she is presented with another photo array of all new photographs except that one photograph that she had some draw to from the earlier array is repeated in the second array
and a positive identification is made because the photograph replaced the memory if there ever was an actual memory
photography offered the criminal justice system a tool that transformed innocent citizens into criminals and the criminal justice system failed to recognize the limitations of relying on photographic identifications
frederick daye who is photographed at his alibi location where 13 witnesses placed him at the time of the crime
he was convicted by an all-white jury of rape kidnapping and vehicle theft
and he served 10 years of a life sentence
now dna exonerated frederick and it also implicated another man who was serving time in prison
but the victim refused to press charges because she claimed that law enforcement had permanently altered her memory through the use of frederick 's photograph
charles fain was convicted of kidnapping rape and murder of a young girl walking to school
he served 18 years of a death sentence
i photographed him at the scene of the crime at the snake river in idaho
and i photographed all of the wrongfully convicted at sites that came to particular significance in the history of their wrongful conviction
the scene of arrest the scene of misidentification the alibi location
and here the scene of the crime it 's this place to which he 's never been but changed his life forever
so photographing there i was hoping to highlight the tenuous relationship between truth and fiction in both his life and in photography
calvin washington was convicted of capital murder
he served 13 years of a life sentence in waco texas
larry mayes i photographed at the scene of arrest where he hid between two mattresses in gary indiana in this very room to hide from the police
he ended up serving 18 and a half years of an 80 year sentence for rape and robbery
the victim failed to identify larry in two live lineups and then made a positive identification days later from a photo array
larry youngblood served eight years of a 10 and half year sentence in arizona for the abduction and repeated sodomizing of a 10 year old boy at a carnival
he is photographed at his alibi location
ron williamson ron was convicted of the rape and murder of a barmaid at a club and served 11 years of a death sentence
i photographed ron at a baseball field because he had been drafted to the oakland a 's to play professional baseball just before his conviction
and the state 's key witness in ron 's case was in the end the actual perpetrator
ronald jones served eight years of a death sentence for rape and murder of a 28-year-old woman
i photographed him at the scene of arrest in chicago
william gregory was convicted of rape and burglary
he served seven years of a 70 year sentence in kentucky
timothy durham who i photographed at his alibi location where 11 witnesses placed him at the time of the crime was convicted of 3.5 years of a 3220 year sentence for several charges of rape and robbery
he had been misidentified by an 11-year-old victim
troy webb is photographed here at the scene of the crime in virginia
he was convicted of rape kidnapping and robbery and served seven years of a 47 year sentence
troy 's picture was in a photo array that the victim tentatively had some draw toward but said he looked too old
the police went and found a photograph of troy webb from four years earlier which they entered into a photo array days later and he was positively identified
now i 'm going to leave you with a self portrait
and it reiterates that distortion is a constant and our eyes are easily deceived
that 's it thank you

at every stage of our lives we make decisions that will profoundly influence the lives of the people we 're going to become and then when we become those people we 're not always thrilled with the decisions we made
so young people pay good money to get tattoos removed that teenagers paid good money to get
middle-aged people rushed to divorce people who young adults rushed to marry
older adults work hard to lose what middle-aged adults worked hard to gain
on and on and on
the question is as a psychologist that fascinates me is why do we make decisions that our future selves so often regret
now i think one of the reasons i 'll try to convince you today is that we have a fundamental misconception about the power of time
every one of you knows that the rate of change slows over the human lifespan that your children seem to change by the minute but your parents seem to change by the year
but what is the name of this magical point in life where change suddenly goes from a gallop to a crawl
is it teenage years is it middle age
is it old age the answer it turns out for most people is now wherever now happens to be
what i want to convince you today is that all of us are walking around with an illusion an illusion that history our personal history has just come to an end that we have just recently become the people that we were always meant to be and will be for the rest of our lives
let me give you some data to back up that claim
so here 's a study of change in people 's personal values over time
here 's three values
everybody here holds all of them but you probably know that as you grow as you age the balance of these values shifts
so how does it do so
well we asked thousands of people
we asked half of them to predict for us how much their values would change in the next 10 years and the others to tell us how much their values had changed in the last 10 years
and this enabled us to do a really interesting kind of analysis because it allowed us to compare the predictions of people say 18 years old to the reports of people who were 28 and to do that kind of analysis throughout the lifespan
here 's what we found
first of all you are right change does slow down as we age but second you 're wrong because it doesn 't slow nearly as much as we think
at every age from 18 to 68 in our data set people vastly underestimated how much change they would experience over the next 10 years
we call this the end of history illusion
to give you an idea of the magnitude of this effect you can connect these two lines and what you see here is that 18-year-olds anticipate changing only as much as 50-year-olds actually do
now it 's not just values it 's all sorts of other things
for example personality
many of you know that psychologists now claim that there are five fundamental dimensions of personality neuroticism openness to experience agreeableness extraversion and conscientiousness
again we asked people how much they expected to change over the next 10 years and also how much they had changed over the last 10 years and what we found well you 're going to get used to seeing this diagram over and over because once again the rate of change does slow as we age but at every age people underestimate how much their personalities will change in the next decade
and it isn 't just ephemeral things like values and personality
you can ask people about their likes and dislikes their basic preferences
for example name your best friend your favorite kind of vacation what 's your favorite hobby what 's your favorite kind of music
people can name these things
we ask half of them to tell us do you think that that will change over the next 10 years
and half of them to tell us did that change over the last 10 years
and what we find well you 've seen it twice now and here it is again people predict that the friend they have now is the friend they 'll have in 10 years the vacation they most enjoy now is the one they 'll enjoy in 10 years and yet people who are 10 years older all say eh you know that 's really changed
does any of this matter
is this just a form of mis-prediction that doesn 't have consequences
no it matters quite a bit and i 'll give you an example of why
it bedevils our decision-making in important ways
bring to mind right now for yourself your favorite musician today and your favorite musician 10 years ago
i put mine up on the screen to help you along
now we asked people to predict for us to tell us how much money they would pay right now to see their current favorite musician perform in concert 10 years from now and on average people said they would pay 129 dollars for that ticket
and yet when we asked them how much they would pay to see the person who was their favorite 10 years ago perform today they say only 80 dollars
now in a perfectly rational world these should be the same number but we overpay for the opportunity to indulge our current preferences because we overestimate their stability
why does this happen we 're not entirely sure but it probably has to do with the ease of remembering versus the difficulty of imagining
most of us can remember who we were 10 years ago but we find it hard to imagine who we 're going to be and then we mistakenly think that because it 's hard to imagine it 's not likely to happen
sorry when people say i can 't imagine that they 're usually talking about their own lack of imagination and not about the unlikelihood of the event that they 're describing
the bottom line is time is a powerful force
it transforms our preferences
it reshapes our values
it alters our personalities
we seem to appreciate this fact but only in retrospect
only when we look backwards do we realize how much change happens in a decade
it 's as if for most of us the present is a magic time
it 's a watershed on the timeline
it 's the moment at which we finally become ourselves
human beings are works in progress that mistakenly think they 're finished
the person you are right now is as transient as fleeting and as temporary as all the people you 've ever been
the one constant in our life is change
thank you
think about your day for a second
you woke up felt fresh air on your face as you walked out the door encountered new colleagues and had great discussions and felt in awe when you found something new
but i bet there 's something you didn 't think about today something so close to home that you probably don 't think about it very often at all
and that 's that all the sensations feelings decisions and actions are mediated by the computer in your head called the brain
now the brain may not look like much from the outside a couple pounds of pinkish-gray flesh amorphous but the last hundred years of neuroscience have allowed us to zoom in on the brain and to see the intricacy of what lies within
and they 've told us that this brain is an incredibly complicated circuit made out of hundreds of billions of cells called neurons
now unlike a human-designed computer where there 's a fairly small number of different parts we know how they work because we humans designed them the brain is made out of thousands of different kinds of cells maybe tens of thousands
they come in different shapes they 're made out of different molecules
and they project and connect to different brain regions and they also change different ways in different disease states
let 's make it concrete
there 's a class of cells a fairly small cell an inhibitory cell that quiets its neighbors
it 's one of the cells that seems to be atrophied in disorders like schizophrenia
it 's called the basket cell
and this cell is one of the thousands of kinds of cell that we are learning about
new ones are being discovered everyday
as just a second example these pyramidal cells large cells they can span a significant fraction of the brain
they 're excitatory
and these are some of the cells that might be overactive in disorders such as epilepsy
every one of these cells is an incredible electrical device
they receive input from thousands of upstream partners and compute their own electrical outputs which then if they pass a certain threshold will go to thousands of downstream partners
and this process which takes just a millisecond or so happens thousands of times a minute in every one of your 100 billion cells as long as you live and think and feel
so how are we going to figure out what this circuit does
ideally we could go through the circuit and turn these different kinds of cell on and off and see whether we could figure out which ones contribute to certain functions and which ones go wrong in certain pathologies
if we could activate cells we could see what powers they can unleash what they can initiate and sustain
if we could turn them off then we could try and figure out what they 're necessary for
and that 's a story i 'm going to tell you about today
and honestly where we 've gone through over the last 11 years through an attempt to find ways of turning circuits and cells and parts and pathways of the brain on and off both to understand the science and also to confront some of the issues that face us all as humans
now before i tell you about the technology the bad news is that a significant fraction of us in this room if we live long enough will encounter perhaps a brain disorder
already a billion people have had some kind of brain disorder that incapacitates them and the numbers don 't do it justice though
these disorders schizophrenia alzheimer 's depression addiction they not only steal our time to live they change who we are
they take our identity and change our emotions and change who we are as people
now in the 20th century there was some hope that was generated through the development of pharmaceuticals for treating brain disorders and while many drugs have been developed that can alleviate symptoms of brain disorders practically none of them can be considered to be cured
and part of that 's because we 're bathing the brain in the chemical
this elaborate circuit made out of thousands of different kinds of cell is being bathed in a substance
that 's also why perhaps most of the drugs and not all on the market can present some kind of serious side effect too
now some people have gotten some solace from electrical stimulators that are implanted in the brain
and for parkinson 's disease cochlear implants these have indeed been able to bring some kind of remedy to people with certain kinds of disorder
but electricity also will go in all directions the path of least resistance which is where that phrase in part comes from
and it also will affect normal circuits as well as the abnormal ones that you want to fix
so again we 're sent back to the idea of ultra-precise control
could we dial-in information precisely where we want it to go
so when i started in neuroscience 11 years ago i had trained as an electrical engineer and a physicist and the first thing i thought about was if these neurons are electrical devices all we need to do is to find some way of driving those electrical changes at a distance
if we could turn on the electricity in one cell but not its neighbors that would give us the tool we need to activate and shut down these different cells figure out what they do and how they contribute to the networks in which they 're embedded
and also it would allow us to have the ultra-precise control we need in order to fix the circuit computations that have gone awry
now how are we going to do that
well there are many molecules that exist in nature which are able to convert light into electricity
you can think of them as little proteins that are like solar cells
if we can install these molecules in neurons somehow then these neurons would become electrically drivable with light
and their neighbors which don 't have the molecule would not
there 's one other magic trick you need to make this all happen and that 's the ability to get light into the brain
and to do that the brain doesn 't feel pain you can put taking advantage of all the effort that 's gone into the internet and communications and so on optical fibers connected to lasers that you can use to activate in animal models for example in pre-clinical studies these neurons and to see what they do
so how do we do this
around 2004 in collaboration with gerhard nagel and karl deisseroth this vision came to fruition
there 's a certain alga that swims in the wild and it needs to navigate towards light in order to photosynthesize optimally
and it senses light with a little eye-spot which works not unlike how our eye works
in its membrane or its boundary it contains little proteins that indeed can convert light into electricity
so these molecules are called channelrhodopsins
and each of these proteins acts just like that solar cell that i told you about
when blue light hits it it opens up a little hole and allows charged particles to enter the eye-spot and that allows this eye-spot to have an electrical signal just like a solar cell charging up a battery
so what we need to do is to take these molecules and somehow install them in neurons
and because it 's a protein it 's encoded for in the dna of this organism
so all we 've got to do is take that dna put it into a gene therapy vector like a virus and put it into neurons
so it turned out that this was a very productive time in gene therapy and lots of viruses were coming along
so this turned out to be very simple to do
and early in the morning one day in the summer of 2004 we gave it a try and it worked on the first try
you take this dna and you put it into a neuron
the neuron uses its natural protein-making machinery to fabricate these little light-sensitive proteins and install them all over the cell like putting solar panels on a roof and the next thing you know you have a neuron which can be activated with light
so this is very powerful
one of the tricks you have to do is to figure out how to deliver these genes to the cells that you want and not all the other neighbors
and you can do that you can tweak the viruses so they hit just some cells and not others
and there 's other genetic tricks you can play in order to get light-activated cells
this field has now come to be known as optogenetics
and just as one example of the kind of thing you can do you can take a complex network use one of these viruses to deliver the gene just to one kind of cell in this dense network
and then when you shine light on the entire network just that cell type will be activated
so for example lets sort of consider that basket cell i told you about earlier the one that 's atrophied in schizophrenia and the one that is inhibitory
if we can deliver that gene to these cells and they 're not going to be altered by the expression of the gene of course and then flash blue light over the entire brain network just these cells are going to be driven
and when the light turns off these cells go back to normal so they don 't seem to be averse against that
not only can you use this to study what these cells do what their power is in computing in the brain but you can also use this to try to figure out well maybe we could jazz up the activity of these cells if indeed they 're atrophied
now i want to tell you a couple of short stories about how we 're using this both at the scientific clinical and pre-clinical levels
one of the questions we 've confronted is what are the signals in the brain that mediate the sensation of reward
because if you could find those those would be some of the signals that could drive learning
the brain will do more of whatever got that reward
and also these are signals that go awry in disorders such as addiction
so if we could figure out what cells they are we could maybe find new targets for which drugs could be designed or screened against or maybe places where electrodes could be put in for people who have very severe disability
so to do that we came up with a very simple paradigm in collaboration with the fiorella group where one side of this little box if the animal goes there the animal gets a pulse of light in order to make different cells in the brain sensitive to light
so if these cells can mediate reward the animal should go there more and more
and so that 's what happens
this animal 's going to go to the right-hand side and poke his nose there and he gets a flash of blue light every time he does that
and he 'll do that hundreds and hundreds of times
these are the dopamine neurons which some of you may have heard about in some of the pleasure centers in the brain
now we 've shown that a brief activation of these is enough indeed to drive learning
now we can generalize the idea
instead of one point in the brain we can devise devices that span the brain that can deliver light into three-dimensional patterns arrays of optical fibers each coupled to its own independent miniature light source
and then we can try to do things in vivo that have only been done to-date in a dish like high-throughput screening throughout the entire brain for the signals that can cause certain things to happen
or that could be good clinical targets for treating brain disorders
and one story i want to tell you about is how can we find targets for treating post-traumatic stress disorder a form of uncontrolled anxiety and fear
and one of the things that we did was to adopt a very classical model of fear
this goes back to the pavlovian days
it 's called pavlovian fear conditioning where a tone ends with a brief shock
the shock isn 't painful but it 's a little annoying
and over time in this case a mouse which is a good animal model commonly used in such experiments the animal learns to fear the tone
the animal will react by freezing sort of like a deer in the headlights
now the question is what targets in the brain can we find that allow us to overcome this fear
so what we do is we play that tone again after it 's been associated with fear
but we activate targets in the brain different ones using that optical fiber array i told you about in the previous slide in order to try and figure out which targets can cause the brain to overcome that memory of fear
and so this brief video shows you one of these targets that we 're working on now
this is an area in the prefrontal cortex a region where we can use cognition to try to overcome aversive emotional states
and the animal 's going to hear a tone and a flash of light occurred there
there 's no audio on this but you can see the animal 's freezing
this tone used to mean bad news
and there 's a little clock in the lower left-hand corner so you can see the animal is about two minutes into this
and now this next clip is just eight minutes later
and the same tone is going to play and the light is going to flash again
okay there it goes right now
and now you can see just 10 minutes into the experiment that we 've equipped the brain by photoactivating this area to overcome the expression of this fear memory
now over the last couple of years we 've gone back to the tree of life because we wanted to find ways to turn circuits in the brain off
if we could do that this could be extremely powerful
if you can delete cells just for a few milliseconds or seconds you can figure out what necessary role they play in the circuits in which they 're embedded
and we 've now surveyed organisms from all over the tree of life every kingdom of life except for animals we see slightly differently
and we found all sorts of molecules they 're called halorhodopsins or archaerhodopsins that respond to green and yellow light
and they do the opposite thing of the molecule i told you about before with the blue light activator channelrhodopsin
let 's give an example of where we think this is going to go
consider for example a condition like epilepsy where the brain is overactive
now if drugs fail in epileptic treatment one of the strategies is to remove part of the brain
but that 's obviously irreversible and there could be side effects
what if we could just turn off that brain for a brief amount of time until the seizure dies away and cause the brain to be restored to its initial state sort of like a dynamical system that 's being coaxed down into a stable state
so this animation just tries to explain this concept where we made these cells sensitive to being turned off with light and we beam light in and just for the time it takes to shut down a seizure we 're hoping to be able to turn it off
and so we don 't have data to show you on this front but we 're very excited about this
now i want to close on one story which we think is another possibility which is that maybe these molecules if you can do ultra-precise control can be used in the brain itself to make a new kind of prosthetic an optical prosthetic
i already told you that electrical stimulators are not uncommon
seventy-five thousand people have parkinson 's deep-brain stimulators implanted
maybe 100,000 people have cochlear implants which allow them to hear
there 's another thing which is you 've got to get these genes into cells
and new hope in gene therapy has been developed because viruses like the adeno-associated virus which probably most of us around this room have and it doesn 't have any symptoms which have been used in hundreds of patients to deliver genes into the brain or the body
and so far there have not been serious adverse events associated with the virus
there 's one last elephant in the room the proteins themselves which come from algae and bacteria and fungi and all over the tree of life
most of us don 't have fungi or algae in our brains so what is our brain going to do if we put that in
are the cells going to tolerate it will the immune system react
in its early days these have not been done on humans yet but we 're working on a variety of studies to try and examine this and so far we haven 't seen overt reactions of any severity to these molecules or to the illumination of the brain with light
so it 's early days to be upfront but we 're excited about it
i wanted to close with one story which we think could potentially be a clinical application
now there are many forms of blindness where the photoreceptors our light sensors that are in the back of our eye are gone
and the retina of course is a complex structure
now let 's zoom in on it here so we can see it in more detail
the photoreceptor cells are shown here at the top and then the signals that are detected by the photoreceptors are transformed by various computations until finally that layer of cells at the bottom the ganglion cells relay the information to the brain where we see that as perception
in many forms of blindness like retinitis pigmentosa or macular degeneration the photoreceptor cells have atrophied or been destroyed
now how could you repair this
it 's not even clear that a drug could cause this to be restored because there 's nothing for the drug to bind to
on the other hand light can still get into the eye
the eye is still transparent and you can get light in
so what if we could just take these channelrhodopsins and other molecules and install them on some of these other spare cells and convert them into little cameras
and because there 's so many of these cells in the eye potentially they could be very high-resolution cameras
so this is some work that we 're doing
it 's being led by one of our collaborators alan horsager at usc and being sought to be commercialized by a start-up company eos neuroscience which is funded by the nih
and what you see here is a mouse trying to solve a maze
it 's a six-arm maze and there 's a bit of water in the maze to motivate the mouse to move or he 'll just sit there
and the goal of course of this maze is to get out of the water and go to a little platform that 's under the lit top port
now mice are smart so this mouse solves the maze eventually but he does a brute-force search
he 's swimming down every avenue until he finally gets to the platform
so he 's not using vision to do it
these different mice are different mutations that recapitulate different kinds of blindness that affect humans
and so we 're being careful in trying to look at these different models so we come up with a generalized approach
so how are we going to solve this
we 're going to do exactly what we outlined in the previous slide
we 're going to take these blue light photosensors and install them on a layer of cells in the middle of the retina in the back of the eye and convert them into a camera just like installing solar cells all over those neurons to make them light sensitive
light is converted to electricity on them
so this mouse was blind a couple weeks before this experiment and received one dose of this photosensitive molecule in a virus
and now you can see the animal can indeed avoid walls and go to this little platform and make cognitive use of its eyes again
and to point out the power of this these animals are able to get to that platform just as fast as animals that have seen their entire lives
so this pre-clinical study i think bodes hope for the kinds of things we 're hoping to do in the future
to close i want to point out that we 're also exploring new business models for this new field of neurotechnology
we 're developing these tools but we share them freely with hundreds of groups all over the world so people can study and try to treat different disorders
and our hope is that by figuring out brain circuits at a level of abstraction that lets us repair them and engineer them we can take some of these intractable disorders that i told you about earlier practically none of which are cured and in the 21st century make them history
thank you
juan enriquez so some of the stuff is a little dense
but the implications of being able to control seizures or epilepsy with light instead of drugs and being able to target those specifically is a first step
the second thing that i think i heard you say is you can now control the brain in two colors like an on off switch
ed boyden that 's right
je which makes every impulse going through the brain a binary code
right yeah
so with blue light we can drive information and it 's in the form of a one
and by turning things off it 's more or less a zero
so our hope is to eventually build brain coprocessors that work with the brain so we can augment functions in people with disabilities
je and in theory that means that as a mouse feels smells hears touches you can model it out as a string of ones and zeros
sure yeah we 're hoping to use this as a way of testing what neural codes can drive certain behaviors and certain thoughts and certain feelings and use that to understand more about the brain
je does that mean that some day you could download memories and maybe upload them
well that 's something we 're starting to work on very hard
we 're now working on some work where we 're trying to tile the brain with recording elements too
so we can record information and then drive information back in sort of computing what the brain needs in order to augment its information processing
je well that might change a couple things thank you
i started with paragliding
paragliding is taking off from mountains with a paraglider with the possibility to fly cross-country distance just with the use of thermals to soar
also different aerobatic maneuvers are possible with a paraglider
from there i started with skydiving
in this picture you can see there is a four-way skydive four people flying together and on the left hand side it 's the camera flier with the camera mounted to his helmet so he can film the whole jump for the film itself and also for the judging
from regular relative skydiving i went on to freeflying
freeflying is more the three-dimensional skydiving
you can see the skydiver with the red suit he 's in a stand-up position
the one with the yellow-green suit he 's flying head-down
and that 's me in the background carving around the whole formation in freefall also with the helmet cam to film this jump
from freeflying i went on to skysurfing
skysurfing is skydiving with a board on the feet
you can imagine with this big surface of a skysurfing board there is a lot of force a lot of power
of course i can use this power for example for nice spinning we call it helicopter moves
from there i went on to wingsuit flying
wingsuit flying is a suit that i can make fly just only with my body
if i put some tension on my body tension on my suit i can make it fly and as you see the fall rate is much much slower because of the bigger surface
with a proper body position i 'm able to really move forward to gain quite some distance
this is a jump i did in rio de janeiro
you can see the copacabana on the left-hand side
from there with all the skills and knowledge from paragliding and all the different disciplines in skydiving i went on to base jumping
base jumping is skydiving from fixed objects like buildings antennae bridges and earth meaning mountains cliffs
it 's for sure for me it 's the ultimate feeling of being in free fall with all the visual references
so my goal soon was to discover new places that nobody had jumped before
so in summer 2000 i was the first to base jump the eiger north face in switzerland
two years after this i was the first to base jump from matterhorn a very famous mountain that probably everybody knows in here
2005 i did a base jump from the eiger from the monk and from the jungfrau three very famous mountains in switzerland
the special thing on these three jumps were i hiked them all and climbed them all in only one day
in 2008 i jumped the eiffel tower in paris
so with all this knowledge i also wanted to get into stunts
so with some friends we started to do different tricks like for example this jump here i jumped from a paraglider
or here everybody was freezing pretty much except me because it was very cold in austria where we did this filming
everybody sitting in a basket and i was on top of the balloon ready to slide down with my skysurf board
or this jump from a moving truck on the highway
extreme sports on top level like this is only possible if you practice step by step if you really work hard on your skills and on your knowledge
of course you need to be in physical very good condition so i 'm training a lot
you need to have the best possible equipment
and probably the most important is you have to work on your mental skills mental preparation
and all this to come as close as possible to the human dream of being able to fly
so for 2009 i 'm training hard for my two new projects
the first one i want to set a world record in flying from a cliff with my wingsuit
and i want to set a new record with the longest distance ever flown
for my second project i have a sensational idea of a jump that never has been done before
so now on the following movie you will see that i 'm much better in flying a wingsuit than speaking in english
enjoy and thank you very much
i have some questions
i think we all might have some questions
question one so does that actually feel the way the flying dream does
because it looks like it might
ueli gegenschatz pretty much i believe this is probably the closest possibility to come to the dream of being able to fly
i know the answer to this but how do you land
ue parachute we have to open a parachute just seconds before i would say impact
it 's not possible to land a wingsuit yet
yet but people are trying are you among those you 're not going to commit are you among those trying to do it
ue it 's a dream it 's a dream yeah
we 're still working on it and we 're developing the wingsuits to get better performance to get more knowledge
and i believe soon
all right well we will watch this space but i have two more questions
what is the there was exhaust coming out of the back of the wingsuit was that a propelled wingsuit that you were wearing
ue nope it 's just smoke
coming off of you
ue hopefully not
that seems dangerous
ue no smoke is for two reasons you can see the speed you can see the way where i was flying
that 's reason number one and reason number two it 's much easier for the camera guy to film if i 'm using smoke
ah i see so the wingsuit is set up to deliberately release smoke so that you can be tracked one more question
what do you do to to cover your face
because i just keep thinking of going that fast and having your whole face smushed backwards
are you in a helmet are you in goggles
ue the purest and the best feeling would be with only goggles
and is that how you usually fly
ue usually i 'm wearing a helmet in the mountains i 'm always wearing a helmet because of landings usually it 's difficult it 's not like regular skydiving where you have like the big landings
so you have to be prepared
right now is there anything you don 't do
do people come to you with projects and say we want you to do this
and do you ever say no no i 'm not going to
ue oh of course of course some people have crazy ideas and ... a round of applause ...
ue thank you very much

what i want to do this afternoon is something a little different than what 's scheduled
foreign policy you can figure that out by watching i don 't know rachel maddow or somebody but i want to talk about young people and structure young people and structure
this was last wednesday afternoon at a school in brooklyn new york at cristo rey high school run by the jesuits
and i was talking to this group of students and take a look at them
they were around me in three directions
you 'll noticed that almost all of them are minority
you 'll notice that the building is rather austere
it 's an old new york school building nothing fancy
they still have old blackboards and whatnot
and there are about 300 kids in this school and the school 's been going now for four years and they 're about to graduate their first class
twenty-two people are graduating and all 22 are going to college
they all come from homes where there is for the most part just one person in the home usually the mother or the grandmother and that 's it and they come here for their education and for their structure
now i had this picture taken and it was put up on my facebook page last week and somebody wrote in huh why does he have him standing at attention like that
and then they said but he looks good
he does look good because kids need structure and the trick i play in all of my school appearances is that when i get through with my little homily to the kids i then invite them to ask questions and when they raise their hands i say come up and i make them come up and stand in front of me
i make them stand at attention like a soldier
put your arms straight down at your side look up open your eyes stare straight ahead and speak out your question loudly so everybody can hear
no slouching no pants hanging down none of that stuff
and this young man his name is his last name cruz he loved it that 's all over his facebook page and it 's gone viral
so people think i 'm being unkind to this kid
no we 're having a little fun
and the thing about it i 've done this for years the younger they are the more fun it is
when i get six- and seven-year-olds in a group i have to figure out how to keep them quiet
you know that they 'll always start yakking
and so i play a little game with them before i make them stand at attention
i say now listen in the army when we want you to pay attention we have a command it 's called at ease it means everybody be quiet and pay attention listen up
do you understand
uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh let 's practice everybody start chatting
and i let them go for about 10 seconds then i go at ease
huh
yes general yes general
try it with your kids see if it works
i don 't think so
but anyway it 's a game i play and it comes obviously from my military experience
because for the majority of my adult life i worked with young kids teenagers with guns i call them
and we would bring them into the army and the first thing we would do is to put them in an environment of structure put them in ranks make them all wear the same clothes cut all their hair off so they look alike make sure that they are standing in ranks
we teach them how to go right face left face so they can obey instructions and know the consequences of not obeying instructions
it gives them structure
and then we introduce them to somebody who they come to hate immediately the drill sergeant
and they hate him
and the drill sergeant starts screaming at them and telling them to do all kinds of awful things
but then the most amazing thing happens over time
once that structure is developed once they understand the reason for something once they understand mama ain 't here son
i 'm your worst nightmare i 'm your daddy and your mommy
and that 's just the way it is you got that son
yeah and then when i ask you a question there are only three possible answers yes sir no sir and no excuse sir
don 't start telling me why you didn 't do something
it 's yes sir no sir no excuse sir
you didn 't shave but sir no don 't tell me how often you scraped your face this morning
i 'm telling you you didn 't shave
no excuse sir attaboy you 're learning fast
but you 'd be amazed at what you can do with them once you put them in that structure
in 18 weeks they have a skill they are mature
and you know what they come to admire the drill sergeant and they never forget the drill sergeant
they come to respect him
and so we need more of this kind of structure and respect in the lives of our children
i spend a lot of time with youth groups and i say to people when does the education process begin
we 're always talking about let 's fix the schools
let 's do more for our teachers let 's put more computers in our schools
let 's get it all online
that isn 't the whole answer it 's part of the answer
but the real answer begins with bringing a child to the school with structure in that child 's heart and soul to begin with
when does the learning process begin does it begin in first grade
no no it begins the first time a child in a mother 's arms looks up at the mother and says oh this must be my mother
she 's the one who feeds me
oh yeah when i don 't feel so good down there she takes care of me
it 's her language i will learn
and at that moment they shut out all the other languages that they could be learning at that age but by three months that 's her
and if the person doing it whether it 's the mother or grandmother whoever 's doing it that is when the education process begins
that 's when language begins
that 's when love begins that 's when structure begins
that 's when you start to imprint on the child that you are special you are different from every other child in the world
and we 're going to read to you
a child who has not been read to is in danger when that child gets to school
a child who doesn 't know his or her colors or doesn 't know how to tell time doesn 't know how to tie shoes doesn 't know how to do those things and doesn 't know how to do something that goes by a word that was drilled into me as a kid mind
mind your manners mind your adults mind what you 're saying
this is the way children are raised properly
and i watched my own young grandchildren now come along and they 're much to the distress of my children they are acting just like we did you know you imprint them
and that 's what you have to do to prepare children for education and for school
and i 'm working at all the energy i have to sort of communicate this message that we need preschool we need head start we need prenatal care
the education process begins even before the child is born and if you don 't do that you 're going to have difficulty
and we are having difficulties in so many of our communities and so many of our schools where kids are coming to first grade and their eyes are blazing they 've got their little knapsack on and they 're ready to go and then they realize they 're not like the other first graders who know books have been read to can do their alphabet
and by the third grade the kids who didn 't have that structure and minding in the beginning start to realize they 're behind and what do they do
they act it out they act it out and they 're on their way to jail or they 're on their way to being dropouts
it 's predictable
if you 're not at the right reading level at third grade you are a candidate for jail at age 18 and we have the highest incarceration rate because we 're not getting our kids the proper start in life
the last chapter in my book is called the gift of a good start
the gift of a good start every child ought to have a good start in life
i was privileged to have that kind of good start
i was not a great student
i was a public school kid in new york city and i didn 't do well at all
i have my entire new york city board of education transcript from kindergarten through college
i wanted it when i was writing my first book
i wanted to see if my memory was correct and my god it was
straight c everywhere
and i finally bounced through high school got into the city college of new york with a 78.3 average which i shouldn 't have been allowed in with and then i started out in engineering and that only lasted six months
and then i went into geology rocks for jocks this is easy
and then i found rotc
i found something that i did well and something that i loved doing and i found a group of youngsters like me who felt the same way
and so my whole life then was dedicated to rotc and the military
and i say to young kids everywhere as you 're growing up and as this structure is being developed inside of you always be looking for that which you do well and that which you love doing and when you find those two things together man you got it
that 's what 's going on and that 's what i found
now the authorities at ccny were getting tired of me being there
i 'd been there four and a half going on five years and my grades were not doing particularly well and i was in occasional difficulties with the administration
and so they said but he does so well in rotc
look he gets straight a 's in that but not in anything else
and so they said look let 's take his rotc grades and roll them into his overall gpa and see what happens
and they did and it brought me up to 2.0
yep
they said it 's good enough for government work
give him to the army we 'll never see him again we 'll never see him again
so they shipped me off to the army and lo and behold many years later i 'm considered one of the greatest sons the city college of new york has ever had
so i tell young people everywhere it ain 't where you start in life it 's what you do with life that determines where you end up in life and you are blessed to be living in a country that no matter where you start you have opportunities so long as you believe in yourself you believe in the society and the country and you believe that you can self-improve and educate yourself as you go along
and that 's the key to success
but it begins with the gift of a good start
if we don 't give that gift to each and every one of our kids if we don 't invest at the earliest age we 're going to be running into difficulties
it 's why we have a dropout rate of roughly 25 percent overall and almost 50 percent of our minority population living in low-income areas because they 're not getting the gift of a good start
my gift of a good start was not only being in a nice family a good family but having a family that said to me now listen we came to this country in banana boats in 1920 and 1924
we worked like dogs down in the garment industry every single day
we 're not doing it so that you can stick something up your nose or get in trouble and don 't even think about dropping out
if i had ever gone home and told those immigrant people that you know i 'm tired of school and i 'm dropping out they 'd said we 're dropping you out we 'll get another kid
they had expectations for all of the cousins and the extended family of immigrants that lived in the south bronx but they had more than just expectations for us
they stuck into our hearts like a dagger a sense of shame don 't you shame this family
sometimes i would get in trouble and my parents were coming home and i was in my room waiting for what 's going to happen and i would sit there saying to myself okay look take the belt and hit me but god don 't give me that shame the family bit again
it devastated me when my mother did that to me
and i also had this extended network
children need a network children need to be part of a tribe a family a community
in my case it was aunts who lived in all of these tenement buildings
i don 't know how many of you are new yorkers but there were these tenement buildings and these women were always hanging out one of the windows leaning on a pillow
they never left
i so help me god i grew up walking those streets and they were always there
they never went to the bathroom they never cooked
they never did anything
but what they did was keep us in play
they kept us in play
and they didn 't care whether you became a doctor or a lawyer or a general and they never expected any generals in the family as long as you got an education and then you got a job
don 't give us any of that self-actualization stuff
you get a job and get out of the house
we don 't have time to waste for that
and then you can support us that 's the role of you guys
and so it 's so essential that we kind of put this culture back into our families all families
and it is so important that all of you here today who are successful people and i 'm sure have wonderful families and children and grandchildren it 's not enough you 've got to reach out and back and find kids like mr. cruz who can make it if you give them the structure if you reach back and help if you mentor if you invest in boys and girls clubs if you work with your school system make sure it 's the best school system and not just your kid 's school but the school uptown in harlem not just downtown montessori on the west side
all of us have to have a commitment to do that
and we 're not just investing in the kids
we 're investing in our future
we 're going to be a minority-majority country in one more generation
those that we call minorities now are going to be the majority
and we have to make sure that they are ready to be the majority
we have to make sure they 're ready to be the leaders of this great country of ours a country that is like no other a country that amazes me every single day a country that 's fractious we 're always arguing with each other
that 's how the system 's supposed to work
it 's a country of such contrasts but it 's a nation of nations
we touch every nation every nation touches us
we are a nation of immigrants
that 's why we need sound immigration policy
it 's ridiculous not to have a sound immigration policy to welcome those who want to come here and be part of this great nation or we can send back home with an education to help their people rise up out of poverty
one of the great stories i love to tell is about my love of going to my hometown of new york and walking up park avenue on a beautiful day and admiring everything and seeing all the people go by from all over the world
but what i always have to do is stop at one of the corners and get a hot dog from the immigrant pushcart peddler
gotta have a dirty water dog
and no matter where i am or what i 'm doing i 've got to do that
i even did it when i was secretary of state
i 'd come out of my suite at the waldorf astoria be walking up the street and i would hit around 55th street looking for the immigrant pushcart peddler
in those days i had five bodyguards around me and three new york city police cars would roll alongside to make sure nobody whacked me while i was going up park avenue
and i would order the hot dog from the guy and he 'd start to fix it and then he 'd look around at the bodyguards and the police cars i 've got a green card i 've got a green card
it 's okay it 's okay
but now i 'm alone i 'm alone
i 've got no bodyguards i 've got no police cars i 've got nothing
but i gotta have my hot dog
i did it just last week it was on a tuesday evening down by columbus circle
and the scene repeats itself so often
i 'll go up and ask for my hot dog and the guy will fix it and as he 's finishing he 'll say i know you i see you on television
you 're well you 're general powell
yes yes oh ... i hand him the money
no general you can 't pay me i 've been paid
america has paid me i never forget where i came from
but now i 'm an american sir thank you
i accept the generosity continue up the street and it washes over me my god it 's the same country that greeted my parents this way 90 years ago
so we are still that magnificent country but we are fueled by young people coming up from every land in the world and it is our obligation as contributing citizens to this wonderful country of ours to make sure that no child gets left behind
thank you very much
so i didn 't always make my living from music
for about the five years after graduating from an upstanding liberal arts university this was my day job
i was a self-employed living statue called the 8-foot bride and i love telling people l did this for a job because everybody always wants to know who are these freaks in real life
hello
i painted myself white one day stood on a box put a hat or a can at my feet and when someone came by and dropped in money i handed them a flower and some intense eye contact
and if they didn 't take the flower i threw in a gesture of sadness and longing as they walked away
so i had the most profound encounters with people especially lonely people who looked like they hadn 't talked to anyone in weeks and we would get this beautiful moment of prolonged eye contact being allowed in a city street and we would sort of fall in love a little bit
and my eyes would say thank you i see you
and their eyes would say nobody ever sees me thank you
and i would get harassed sometimes
people would yell at me from their passing cars
get a job
and i 'd be like this is my job
but it hurt because it made me fear that i was somehow doing something un-joblike and unfair shameful
i had no idea how perfect a real education i was getting for the music business on this box
and for the economists out there you may be interested to know i actually made a pretty predictable income which was shocking to me given i had no regular customers but pretty much 60 bucks on a tuesday 90 bucks on a friday
it was consistent
and meanwhile i was touring locally and playing in nightclubs with my band the dresden dolls
this was me on piano a genius drummer
i wrote the songs and eventually we started making enough money that i could quit being a statue and as we started touring i really didn 't want to lose this sense of direct connection with people because i loved it
so after all of our shows we would sign autographs and hug fans and hang out and talk to people and we made an art out of asking people to help us and join us and i would track down local musicians and artists and they would set up outside of our shows and they would pass the hat and then they would come in and join us onstage so we had this rotating smorgasbord of weird random circus guests
and then twitter came along and made things even more magic because i could ask instantly for anything anywhere
so i would need a piano to practice on and an hour later i would be at a fan 's house this is in london
people would bring home-cooked food to us all over the world backstage and feed us and eat with us this is in seattle
fans who worked in museums and stores and any kind of public space would wave their hands if i would decide to do a last-minute spontaneous free gig
this is a library in auckland
on saturday i tweeted for this crate and hat because i did not want to schlep them from the east coast and they showed up care of this dude chris from newport beach who says hello
i once tweeted where in melbourne can i buy a neti pot
and a nurse from a hospital drove one right at that moment to the cafe i was in and i bought her a smoothie and we sat there talking about nursing and death
and i love this kind of random closeness which is lucky because i do a lot of couchsurfing
in mansions where everyone in my crew gets their own room but there 's no wireless and in punk squats everyone on the floor in one room with no toilets but with wireless clearly making it the better option
my crew once pulled our van up to a really poor miami neighborhood and we found out that our couchsurfing host for the night was an 18-year-old girl still living at home and her family were all undocumented immigrants from honduras
and that night her whole family took the couches and she slept together with her mom so that we could take their beds
and i lay there thinking these people have so little
is this fair
and in the morning her mom taught us how to try to make tortillas and wanted to give me a bible and she took me aside and she said to me in her broken english your music has helped my daughter so much
thank you for staying here we 're all so grateful
and i thought this is fair
this is this
a couple months later i was in manhattan and i tweeted for a crash pad and at midnight i 'm ringing a doorbell on the lower east side and it occurs to me i 've never actually done this alone
i 've always been with my band or my crew
is this what stupid people do
is this how stupid people die
and before i can change my mind the door busts open
she 's an artist he 's a financial blogger for reuters and they 're pouring me a glass of red wine and offering me a bath and i have had thousands of nights like that and like that
so i couchsurf a lot i also crowdsurf a lot
i maintain couchsurfing and crowdsurfing are basically the same thing
you 're falling into the audience and you 're trusting each other
i once asked an opening band of mine if they wanted to go out into the crowd and pass the hat to get themselves some extra money something that i did a lot
and as usual the band was psyched but there was this one guy in the band who told me he just couldn 't bring himself to go out there
it felt too much like begging to stand there with the hat
and i recognized his fear of is this fair and get a job
and meanwhile my band is becoming bigger and bigger
we signed with a major label
and our music is a cross between punk and cabaret
it 's not for everybody
well maybe it 's for you
we sign and there 's all this hype leading up to our next record
and it comes out and it sells about 25,000 copies in the first few weeks and the label considers this a failure
and i was like 25,000 isn 't that a lot
they were like no the sales are going down it 's a failure
and they walk off
right at this same time i 'm signing and hugging after a gig and a guy comes up to me and hands me a $ 10 bill and he says i 'm sorry i burned your cd from a friend
but i read your blog i know you hate your label
i just want you to have this money
and this starts happening all the time
i become the hat after my own gigs but i have to physically stand there and take the help from people and unlike the guy in the opening band i 've actually had a lot of practice standing there
thank you
and this is the moment i decide i 'm just going to give away my music for free online whenever possible so it 's like metallica over here napster bad amanda palmer over here and i 'm going to encourage torrenting downloading sharing but i 'm going to ask for help because i saw it work on the street
so i fought my way off my label and for my next project with my new band the grand theft orchestra i turned to crowdfunding and i fell into those thousands of connections that i 'd made and i asked my crowd to catch me
and the goal was 100,000 dollars
my fans backed me at nearly 1.2 million which was the biggest music crowdfunding project to date
and you can see how many people it is
it 's about 25,000 people
and the media asked amanda the music business is tanking and you encourage piracy
how did you make all these people pay for music
and the real answer is i didn 't make them i asked them
and through the very act of asking people i 'd connected with them and when you connect with them people want to help you
it 's kind of counterintuitive for a lot of artists
they don 't want to ask for things
but it 's not easy it 's not easy to ask
and a lot of artists have a problem with this
asking makes you vulnerable
and i got a lot of criticism online after my kickstarter went big for continuing my crazy crowdsourcing practices specifically for asking musicians who are fans if they wanted to join us on stage for a few songs in exchange for love and tickets and beer and this was a doctored image that went up of me on a website
and this hurt in a really familiar way
and people saying you 're not allowed anymore to ask for that kind of help really reminded me of the people in their cars yelling get a job
because they weren 't with us on the sidewalk and they couldn 't see the exchange that was happening between me and my crowd an exchange that was very fair to us but alien to them
so this is slightly not safe for work
this is my kickstarter backer party in berlin
at the end of the night i stripped and let everyone draw on me
now let me tell you if you want to experience the visceral feeling of trusting strangers i recommend this especially if those strangers are drunk german people
this was a ninja master-level fan connection because what i was really saying here was i trust you this much
should i show me
for most of human history musicians artists they 've been part of the community connectors and openers not untouchable stars
celebrity is about a lot of people loving you from a distance but the internet and the content that we 're freely able to share on it are taking us back
it 's about a few people loving you up close and about those people being enough
so a lot of people are confused by the idea of no hard sticker price
they see it as an unpredictable risk but the things i 've done the kickstarter the street the doorbell i don 't see these things as risk
i see them as trust
now the online tools to make the exchange as easy and as instinctive as the street they 're getting there
but the perfect tools aren 't going to help us if we can 't face each other and give and receive fearlessly but more important to ask without shame
my music career has been spent trying to encounter people on the internet the way i could on the box so blogging and tweeting not just about my tour dates and my new video but about our work and our art and our fears and our hangovers our mistakes and we see each other
and i think when we really see each other we want to help each other
i think people have been obsessed with the wrong question which is how do we make people pay for music
what if we started asking how do we let people pay for music
thank you
the two most likely largest inventions of our generation are the internet and the mobile phone
they 've changed the world
however largely to our surprise they also turned out to be the perfect tools for the surveillance state
it turned out that the capability to collect data information and connections about basically any of us and all of us is exactly what we 've been hearing throughout of the summer through revelations and leaks about western intelligence agencies mostly u.s. intelligence agencies watching over the rest of the world
we 've heard about these starting with the revelations from june 6
edward snowden started leaking information top secret classified information from the u.s. intelligence agencies and we started learning about things like prism and xkeyscore and others
and these are examples of the kinds of programs u.s. intelligence agencies are running right now against the whole rest of the world
and if you look back about the forecasts on surveillance by george orwell well it turns out that george orwell was an optimist
we are right now seeing a much larger scale of tracking of individual citizens than he could have ever imagined
and this here is the infamous nsa data center in utah
due to be opened very soon it will be both a supercomputing center and a data storage center
you could basically imagine it has a large hall filled with hard drives storing data they are collecting
and it 's a pretty big building
how big well i can give you the numbers 140,000 square meters but that doesn 't really tell you very much
maybe it 's better to imagine it as a comparison
you think about the largest ikea store you 've ever been in
this is five times larger
how many hard drives can you fit in an ikea store
right it 's pretty big
we estimate that just the electricity bill for running this data center is going to be in the tens of millions of dollars a year
and this kind of wholesale surveillance means that they can collect our data and keep it basically forever keep it for extended periods of time keep it for years keep it for decades
and this opens up completely new kinds of risks to us all
and what this is is that it is wholesale blanket surveillance on everyone
well not exactly everyone because the u.s. intelligence only has a legal right to monitor foreigners
they can monitor foreigners when foreigners data connections end up in the united states or pass through the united states
and monitoring foreigners doesn 't sound too bad until you realize that i 'm a foreigner and you 're a foreigner
in fact 96 percent of the planet are foreigners
right
so it is wholesale blanket surveillance of all of us all of us who use telecommunications and the internet
but don 't get me wrong there are actually types of surveillance that are okay
i love freedom but even i agree that some surveillance is fine
if the law enforcement is trying to find a murderer or they 're trying to catch a drug lord or trying to prevent a school shooting and they have leads and they have suspects then it 's perfectly fine for them to tap the suspect 's phone and to intercept his internet communications
i 'm not arguing that at all but that 's not what programs like prism are about
they are not about doing surveillance on people that they have reason to suspect of some wrongdoings
they 're about doing surveillance on people they know are innocent
so the four main arguments supporting surveillance like this well the first of all is that whenever you start discussing about these revelations there will be naysayers trying to minimize the importance of these revelations saying that we knew all this already we knew it was happening there 's nothing new here
and that 's not true don 't let anybody tell you that we knew this already because we did not know this already
our worst fears might have been something like this but we didn 't know this was happening
now we know for a fact it 's happening
we didn 't know about this we didn 't know about prism
we didn 't know about xkeyscore we didn 't know about cybertrans
we didn 't know about doublearrow
we did not know about skywriter all these different programs run by u.s. intelligence agencies
but now we do
and we did not know that u.s. intelligence agencies go to extremes such as infiltrating standardization bodies to sabotage encryption algorithms on purpose
and what that means is that you take something which is secure an encryption algorithm which is so secure that if you use that algorithm to encrypt one file nobody can decrypt that file
even if they take every single computer on the planet just to decrypt that one file it 's going to take millions of years
so that 's basically perfectly safe uncrackable
you take something which is that good and then you weaken it on purpose making all of us less secure as an end result
a real-world equivalent would be that intelligence agencies would force some secret pin code into every single house alarm so they could get into every single house because you know bad people might have house alarms but it will also make all of us less secure as an end result
backdooring encryption algorithms just boggles the mind
but of course these intelligence agencies are doing their job
this is what they have been told to do do signals intelligence monitor telecommunications monitor internet traffic
that 's what they 're trying to do and since most a very big part of the internet traffic today is encrypted they 're trying to find ways around the encryption
one way is to sabotage encryption algorithms which is a great example about how u.s. intelligence agencies are running loose
they are completely out of control and they should be brought back under control
so what do we actually know about the leaks
everything is based on the files leaked by mr. snowden
the very first prism slides from the beginning of june detail a collection program where the data is collected from service providers and they actually go and name the service providers they have access to
they even have a specific date on when the collection of data began for each of the service providers
so for example they name the collection from microsoft started on september 11 2007 for yahoo on the march 12 2008 and then others google facebook skype apple and so on
and every single one of these companies denies
they all say that this simply isn 't true that they are not giving backdoor access to their data
yet we have these files
so is one of the parties lying or is there some other alternative explanation
and one explanation would be that these parties these service providers are not cooperating
instead they 've been hacked
that would explain it they aren 't cooperating they 've been hacked
in this case they 've been hacked by their own government
that might sound outlandish but we already have cases where this has happened for example the case of the flame malware which we strongly believe was authored by the u.s. government and which to spread subverted the security of the windows update network meaning here the company was hacked by their own government
and there 's more evidence supporting this theory as well
der spiegel from germany leaked more information about the operations run by the elite hacker units operating inside these intelligence agencies
inside nsa the unit is called tao tailored access operations and inside gchq which is the u.k. equivalent it 's called nac network analysis centre
and these recent leaks of these three slides detail an operation run by this gchq intelligence agency from the united kingdom targeting a telecom here in belgium
and what this really means is that an e.u. country 's intelligence agency is breaching the security of a telecom of a fellow e.u. country on purpose and they discuss it in their slides completely casually business as usual
here 's the primary target here 's the secondary target here 's the teaming
they probably have a team building on thursday evening in a pub
they even use cheesy powerpoint clip art like you know success when they gain access to services like this
what the hell
and then there 's the argument that okay yes this might be going on but then again other countries are doing it as well
all countries spy
and maybe that 's true
many countries spy not all of them but let 's take an example
let 's take for example sweden
i 'm speaking of sweden because sweden has a little bit of a similar law to the united states
when your data traffic goes through sweden their intelligence agency has a legal right by the law to intercept that traffic
all right how many swedish decisionmakers and politicians and business leaders use every day u.s.-based services like you know run windows or osx or use facebook or linkedin or store their data in clouds like icloud or skydrive or dropbox or maybe use online services like amazon web services or sales support
and the answer is every single swedish business leader does that every single day
and then we turn it around
how many american leaders use swedish webmails and cloud services
and the answer is zero
so this is not balanced
it 's not balanced by any means not even close
and when we do have the occasional european success story even those then typically end up being sold to the united states
like skype used to be secure
it used to be end-to-end encrypted
then it was sold to the united states
today it no longer is secure
so once again we take something which is secure and then we make it less secure on purpose making all of us less secure as an outcome
and then the argument that the united states is only fighting terrorists
it 's the war on terror
you shouldn 't worry about it
well it 's not the war on terror
yes part of it is war on terror and yes there are terrorists and they do kill and maim and we should fight them but we know through these leaks that they have used the same techniques to listen to phone calls of european leaders to tap the email of residents of mexico and brazil to read email traffic inside the united nations headquarters and e.u. parliament and i don 't think they are trying to find terrorists from inside the e.u. parliament right
it 's not the war on terror
part of it might be and there are terrorists but are we really thinking about terrorists as such an existential threat that we are willing to do anything at all to fight them
are the americans ready to throw away the constituion and throw it in the trash just because there are terrorists
and the same thing with the bill of rights and all the amendments and the universal declaration of human rights and the e.u. conventions on human rights and fundamental freedoms and the press freedom
do we really think terrorism is such an existential threat we are ready to do anything at all
but people are scared about terrorists and then they think that maybe that surveillance is okay because they have nothing to hide
feel free to survey me if that helps
and whoever tells you that they have nothing to hide simply hasn 't thought about this long enough
because we have this thing called privacy and if you really think that you have nothing to hide please make sure that 's the first thing you tell me because then i know that i should not trust you with any secrets because obviously you can 't keep a secret
but people are brutally honest with the internet and when these leaks started many people were asking me about this
and i have nothing to hide
i 'm not doing anything bad or anything illegal
yet i have nothing that i would in particular like to share with an intelligence agency especially a foreign intelligence agency
and if we indeed need a big brother i would much rather have a domestic big brother than a foreign big brother
and when the leaks started the very first thing i tweeted about this was a comment about how when you 've been using search engines you 've been potentially leaking all that to u.s. intelligence
and two minutes later i got a reply by somebody called kimberly from the united states challenging me like why am i worried about this
what am i sending to worry about this am i sending naked pictures or something
and my answer to kimberly was that what i 'm sending is none of your business and it should be none of your government 's business either
because that 's what it 's about it 's about privacy
privacy is nonnegotiable
it should be built in to all the systems we use
and one thing we should all understand is that we are brutally honest with search engines
you show me your search history and i 'll find something incriminating or something embarrassing there in five minutes
we are more honest with search engines than we are with our families
search engines know more about you than your family members know about you
and this is all the kind of information we are giving away we are giving away to the united states
and surveillance changes history
we know this through examples of corrupt presidents like nixon
imagine if he would have had the kind of surveillance tools that are available today
and let me actually quote the president of brazil ms. dilma rousseff
she was one of the targets of nsa surveillance
her email was read and she spoke at the united nations headquarters and she said if there is no right to privacy there can be no true freedom of expression and opinion and therefore there can be no effective democracy
that 's what it 's about
privacy is the building block of our democracies
and to quote a fellow security researcher marcus ranum he said that the united states is right now treating the internet as it would be treating one of its colonies
so we are back to the age of colonization and we the foreign users of the internet we should think about americans as our masters
so mr. snowden he 's been blamed for many things
some are blaming him for causing problems for the u.s. cloud industry and software companies with these revelations and blaming snowden for causing problems for the u.s. cloud industry would be the equivalent of blaming al gore for causing global warming
so what is there to be done
should we worry no we shouldn 't worry
we should be angry because this is wrong and it 's rude and it should not be done
but that 's not going to really change the situation
what 's going to change the situation for the rest of the world is to try to steer away from systems built in the united states
and that 's much easier said than done
how do you do that
a single country any single country in europe cannot replace and build replacements for the u.s.-made operating systems and cloud services
but maybe you don 't have to do it alone
maybe you can do it together with other countries
the solution is open source
by building together open free secure systems we can go around such surveillance and then one country doesn 't have to solve the problem by itself
it only has to solve one little problem
and to quote a fellow security researcher haroon meer one country only has to make a small wave but those small waves together become a tide and the tide will lift all the boats up at the same time and the tide we will build with secure free open-source systems will become the tide that will lift all of us up and above the surveillance state
thank you very much
the substance of things unseen
cities past and future
in oxford perhaps we can use lewis carroll and look in the looking glass that is new york city to try and see our true selves or perhaps pass through to another world
or in the words of f. scott fitzgerald as the moon rose higher the inessential houses began to melt away until gradually i became aware of the old island here that once flowered for dutch sailors eyes a fresh green breast of the new world
my colleagues and i have been working for 10 years to rediscover this lost world in a project we call the mannahatta project
we 're trying to discover what henry hudson would have seen on the afternoon of september 12th 1609 when he sailed into new york harbor
and i 'd like to tell you the story in three acts and if i have time still an epilogue
so act i a map found
so i didn 't grow up in new york
i grew up out west in the sierra nevada mountains like you see here in the red rock canyon
and from these early experiences as a child i learned to love landscapes
and so when it became time for me to do my graduate studies i studied this emerging field of landscape ecology
landscape ecology concerns itself with how the stream and the meadow and the forest and the cliffs make habitats for plants and animals
this experience and this training lead me to get a wonderful job with the wildlife conservation society which works to save wildlife and wild places all over the world
and over the last decade i traveled to over 40 countries to see jaguars and bears and elephants and tigers and rhinos
but every time i would return from my trips i 'd return back to new york city
and on my weekends i would go up just like all the other tourists to the top of the empire state building and i 'd look down on this landscape on these ecosystems and i 'd wonder how does this landscape work to make habitat for plants and animals
how does it work to make habitat for animals like me
i 'd go to times square and i 'd look at the amazing ladies on the wall and wonder why nobody is looking at the historical figures just behind them
i 'd go to central park and see the rolling topography of central park come up against the abrupt and sheer topography of midtown manhattan
i started reading about the history and the geography in new york city
i read that new york city was the first mega-city a city of 10 million people or more in 1950
i started seeing paintings like this
for those of you who are from new york this is 125th street under the west side highway
it was once a beach and this painting has john james audubon the painter sitting on the rock
and it 's looking up on the wooded heights of washington heights to jeffrey 's hook where the george washington bridge goes across today
or this painting from the 1740s from greenwich village
those are two students at king 's college later columbia university sitting on a hill overlooking a valley
and so i 'd go down to greenwich village and i 'd look for this hill and i couldn 't find it and i couldn 't find that palm tree
what 's that palm tree doing there
so it was in the course of these investigations that i ran into a map
and it 's this map you see here
it 's held in a geographic information system which allows me to zoom in
this map isn 't from hudson 's time but from the american revolution 170 years later made by british military cartographers during the occupation of new york city
and it 's a remarkable map it 's in the national archives here in kew
and it 's 10 feet long and three and a half feet wide
and if i zoom in to lower manhattan you can see the extent of new york city as it was right at the end of the american revolution
here 's bowling green and here 's broadway
and this is city hall park
so the city basically extended to city hall park
and just beyond it you can see features that have vanished things that have disappeared
this is the collect pond which was the fresh water source for new york city for its first 200 years and for the native americans for thousands of years before that
you can see the lispenard meadows draining down through here through what is tribeca now and the beaches that come up from the battery all the way to 42nd st .
this map was made for military reasons
they 're mapping the roads the buildings these fortifications that they built
but they 're also mapping things of ecological interest also military interest the hills the marshes the streams
this is richmond hill and minetta water which used to run its way through greenwich village
or the swamp at gramercy park right here
or murray hill and this is the murrays house on murray hill 200 years ago
here is times square the two streams that came together to make a wetland in times square as it was at the end of the american revolution
so i saw this remarkable map in a book
and i thought to myself you know if i could georeference this map if i could place this map in the grid of the city today i could find these lost features of the city in the block-by-block geography that people know the geography of where people go to work and where they go to live and where they like to eat
so after some work we were able to georeference it which allows us to put the modern streets on the city and the buildings and the open spaces so that we can zoom in to where the collect pond is
we can digitize the collect pond and the streams and see where they actually are in the geography of the city today
so this is fun for finding where things are relative to the old topography
but i had another idea about this map
if we take away the streets and if we take away the buildings and if we take away the open spaces then we could take this map
if we pull off the 18th century features we could drive it back in time
we could drive it back to its ecological fundamentals to the hills to the streams to the basic hydrology and shoreline to the beaches the basic aspects that make the ecological landscape
then if we added maps like the geology the bedrock geology and the surface geology what the glaciers leave if we make the soil map with the 17 soil classes that are defined by the national conservation service if we make a digital elevation model of the topography that tells us how high the hills were then we can calculate the slopes
we can calculate the aspect
we can calculate the winter wind exposure so which way the winter winds blow across the landscape
the white areas on this map are the places protected from the winter winds
we compiled all the information about where the native americans were the lenape
and we built a probability map about where they might have been
so the red areas on this map indicate the places that are best for human sustainability on manhattan places that are close to water places that are near the harbor to fish places protected from the winter winds
we know that there was a lenape settlement down here by the collect pond
and we knew that they planted a kind of horticulture that they grew these beautiful gardens of corn beans and squash the three sisters garden
so we built a model that explains where those fields might have been
and the old fields the successional fields that go
and we might think of these as abandoned
but in fact they 're grassland habitats for grassland birds and plants
and they have become successional shrub lands and these then mix in to a map of all the ecological communities
and it turns out that manhattan had 55 different ecosystem types
you can think of these as neighborhoods as distinctive as tribeca and the upper east side and inwood that these are the forest and the wetlands and the marine communities the beaches
and 55 is a lot on a per-area basis manhattan had more ecological communities per acre than yosemite does than yellowstone than amboseli
it was really an extraordinary landscape that was capable of supporting an extraordinary biodiversity
so act ii a home reconstructed
so we studied the fish and the frogs and the birds and the bees the 85 different kinds of fish that were on manhattan the heath hens the species that aren 't there anymore the beavers on all the streams the black bears and the native americans to study how they used and thought about their landscape
we wanted to try and map these and to do that what we did was we mapped their habitat needs
where do they get their food
where do they get their water where do they get their shelter
where do they get their reproductive resources
to an ecologist the intersection of these is habitat but to most people the intersection of these is their home
so we would read in field guides the standard field guides that maybe you have on your shelves you know what beavers need is a slowly meandering stream with aspen trees and alders and willows near the water that 's the best thing for a beaver
so we just started making a list
here is the beaver and here is the stream and the aspen and the alder and the willow
as if these were the maps that we would need to predict where you would find the beaver
or the bog turtle needing wet meadows and insects and sunny places
or the bobcat needing rabbits and beavers and den sites
and rapidly we started to realize that beavers can be something that a bobcat needs
but a beaver also needs things and that having it on either side means that we can link it together that we can create the network of the habitat relationships for these species
moreover we realized that you can start out as being a beaver specialist but you can look up what an aspen needs
an aspen needs fire and dry soils
and you can look at what a wet meadow needs
and it need beavers to create the wetlands and maybe some other things
but you can also talk about sunny places
so what does a sunny place need not habitat per se
but what are the conditions that make it possible
or fire or dry soils
and that you can put these on a grid that 's 1,000 columns long across the top and 1,000 rows down the other way
and then we can visualize this data like a network like a social network
and this is the network of all the habitat relationships of all the plants and animals on manhattan and everything they needed going back to the geology going back to time and space at the very core of the web
we call this the muir web and if you zoom in on it it looks like this
each point is a different species or a different stream or a different soil type
and those little gray lines are the connections that connect them together
they are the connections that actually make nature resilient
and the structure of this is what makes nature work seen with all its parts
we call these muir webs after the scottish-american naturalist john muir who said when we try to pick out anything by itself we find that it 's bound fast by a thousand invisible cords that cannot be broken to everything in the universe
so then we took the muir webs and we took them back to the maps
so if we wanted to go between 85th and 86th and lex and third maybe there was a stream in that block
and these would be the kind of trees that might have been there and the flowers and the lichens and the mosses the butterflies the fish in the stream the birds in the trees
maybe a timber rattlesnake lived there
and perhaps a black bear walked by and maybe native americans were there
and then we took this data
you can see this for yourself on our website
you can zoom into any block on manhattan and see what might have been there 400 years ago
and we used it to try and reveal a landscape here in act iii
we used the tools they use in hollywood to make these fantastic landscapes that we all see in the movies
and we tried to use it to visualize third avenue
so we would take the landscape and we would build up the topography
we 'd lay on top of that the soils and the waters and illuminate the landscape
we would lay on top of that the map of the ecological communities
and feed into that the map of the species
so that we would actually take a photograph flying above times square looking toward the hudson river waiting for hudson to come
using this technology we can make these fantastic georeferenced views
we can basically take a picture out of any window on manhattan and see what that landscape looked like 400 years ago
this is the view from the east river looking up murray hill at where the united nations is today
this is the view looking down the hudson river with manhattan on the left and new jersey out on the right looking out toward the atlantic ocean
this is the view over times square with the beaver pond there looking out toward the east
so we can see the collect pond and lispenard marshes back behind
we can see the fields that the native americans made
and we can see this in the geography of the city today
so when you 're watching law and order and the lawyers walk up the steps they could have walked back down those steps of the new york court house right into the collect pond 400 years ago
so these images are the work of my friend and colleague mark boyer who is here in the audience today
and i 'd just like if you would give him a hand to call out for his fine work
there is such power in bringing science and visualization together that we can create images like this perhaps looking on either side of a looking glass
and even though i 've only had a brief time to speak i hope you appreciate that mannahatta was a very special place
the place that you see here on the left side was interconnected it was based on this diversity
it had this resilience that is what we need in our modern world
but i wouldn 't have you think that i don 't like the place on the right which i quite do i 've come to love the city and its kind of diversity and its resilience and its dependence on density and how we 're connected together
in fact that i see them as reflections of each other much as lewis carroll did in through the looking glass
we can compare these two and hold them in our minds at the same time that they really are the same place that there is no way that cities can escape from nature
and i think this is what we 're learning about building cities in the future
so if you 'll allow me a brief epilogue not about the past but about 400 years from now what we 're realizing is that cities are habitats for people and need to supply what people need a sense of home food water shelter reproductive resources and a sense of meaning
this is the particular additional habitat requirement of humanity
and so many of the talks here at ted are about meaning about bringing meaning to our lives in all kinds of different ways through technology through art through science so much so that i think we focus so much on that side of our lives that we haven 't given enough attention to the food and the water and the shelter and what we need to raise the kids
so how can we envision the city of the future
well what if we go to madison square park and we imagine it without all the cars and bicycles instead and large forests and streams instead of sewers and storm drains
what if we imagined the upper east side with green roofs and streams winding through the city and windmills supplying the power we need
or if we imagine the new york city metropolitan area currently home to 12 million people but 12 million people in the future perhaps living at the density of manhattan in only 36 percent of the area with the areas in between covered by farmland covered by wetlands covered by the marshes we need
this is the kind of future i think we need is a future that has the same diversity and abundance and dynamism of manhattan but that learns from the sustainability of the past of the ecology the original ecology of nature with all its parts
thank you very much
i started improv everywhere about 10 years ago when i moved to new york city with an interest in acting and comedy
because i was new to the city i didn 't have access to a stage so i decided to create my own in public places
so the first project we 're going to take a look at is the very first no pants subway ride
now this took place in january of 2002
and this woman is the star of the video
she doesn 't know she 's being filmed
she 's being filmed with a hidden camera
this is on the 6 train in new york city
and this is the first stop along the line
these are two danish guys who come out and sit down next to the hidden camera
and that 's me right there in a brown coat
it 's about 30 degrees outside
i 'm wearing a hat i 'm wearing a scarf
and the girl 's going to notice me right here
and as you 'll see now i 'm not wearing pants
so at this point at this point she 's noticed me but in new york there 's weirdos on any given train car
one person 's not that unusual
she goes back to reading her book which is unfortunately titled rape
so she 's noticed the unusual thing but she 's gone back to her normal life
now in the meantime i have six friends who are waiting at the next six consecutive stops in their underwear as well
they 're going to be entering this car one by one
we 'll act as though we don 't know each other
and we 'll act as if it 's just an unfortunate mistake we 've made forgetting our pants on this cold january day
so at this point she decides to put the rape book away
and she decides to be a little bit more aware of her surroundings
now in the meantime the two danish guys to the left of the camera they 're cracking up
they think this is the funniest thing they 've ever seen before
and watch her make eye contact with them right about now
and i love that moment in this video because before it became a shared experience it was something that was maybe a little bit scary or something that was at least confusing to her
and then once it became a shared experience it was funny and something that she could laugh at
so the train is now pulling into the third stop along the 6 line
so the video won 't show everything
this goes on for another four stops
a total of seven guys enter anonymously in their underwear
at the eighth stop a girl came in with a giant duffel bag and announced she had pants for sale for a dollar like you might sell batteries or candy on the train
we all very matter of factly bought a pair of pants put them on and said thank you that 's exactly what i needed today and then exited without revealing what had happened and went in all different directions
thank you
so that 's a still from the video there
and i love that girl 's reaction so much
and watching that videotape later that day inspired me to keep doing what i do
and really one of the points of improv everywhere is to cause a scene in a public place that is a positive experience for other people
it 's a prank but it 's a prank that gives somebody a great story to tell
and her reaction inspired me to do a second annual no pants subway ride
and we 've continued to do it every year
this january we did the 10th annual no pants subway ride where a diverse group of 3,500 people rode the train in their underwear in new york almost every single train line in the city
and also in 50 other cities around the world people participated
as i started taking improv class at the upright citizens brigade theater and meeting other creative people and other performers and comedians i started amassing a mailing list of people who wanted to do these types of projects
so i could do more large-scale projects
well one day i was walking through union square and i saw this building which had just been built in 2005
and there was a girl in one of the windows and she was dancing
and it was very peculiar because it was dark out but she was back-lit with florescent lighting and she was very much onstage and i couldn 't figure out why she was doing it
after about 15 seconds her friend appeared she had been hiding behind a display and they laughed and hugged each other and ran away
so it seemed like maybe she had been dared to do this
so i got inspired by that
looking at the entire facade there were 70 total windows and i knew what i had to do
so this project is called look up more we had 70 actors dress in black
this was completely unauthorized
we didn 't let the stores know we were coming
and i stood in the park giving signals
the first signal was for everybody to hold up these four-foot tall letters that spelled out look up more the name of the project
the second signal was for everybody to do jumping jacks together
you 'll see that start right here
and then we had dancing we had everyone dance
and then we had dance solos where only one person would dance and everybody would point to them
so then i gave a new hand signal which signaled the next soloist down below in forever 21 and he danced
there were several other activities
we had people jumping up and down people dropping to the ground
and i was standing just anonymously in a sweatshirt putting my hand on and off of a trashcan to signal the advancement
and because it was in union square park right by a subway station there were hundreds of people by the end who stopped and looked up and watched what we were doing
there 's a better photo of it
so that particular event was inspired by a moment that i happened to stumble upon
the next project i want to show was given to me in an email from a stranger
a high school kid in texas wrote me in 2006 and said you should get as many people as possible to put on blue polo shirts and khaki pants and go into a best buy and stand around
so i wrote this high school kid back immediately and i said yes you are correct
i think i 'll try to do that this weekend thank you
so here 's the video
so again this is 2005
this is the best buy in new york city
we had about 80 people show up to participate entering one-by-one
there was an eight year-old girl a 10 year-old girl
there was also a 65 year-old man who participated
so a very diverse group of people
and i told people don 't work don 't actually do work
but also don 't shop
just stand around and don 't face products
now you can see the regular employees by the ones that have the yellow tags on their shirt
everybody else is one of our actors
the lower level employees thought it was very funny
and in fact several of them went to go get their camera from the break room and took photos with us
a lot of them made jokes about trying to get us to go to the back to get heavy television sets for customers
the managers and the security guards on the other hand did not find it particularly funny
you can see them in this footage
they 're wearing either a yellow shirt or a black shirt
and we were there probably 10 minutes before the managers decided to dial 911
so they started running around telling everybody the cops were coming watch out the cops were coming
and you can see the cops in this footage right here
that 's a cop wearing black right there being filmed with a hidden camera
ultimately the police had to inform best buy management that it was not in fact illegal to wear a blue polo shirt and khaki pants
thank you
so we had been there for 20 minutes we were happy to exit the store
one thing the managers were trying to do was to track down our cameras
and they caught a couple of my guys who had hidden cameras in duffel bags
but the one camera guy they never caught was the guy that went in just with a blank tape and went over to the best buy camera department and just put his tape in one of their cameras and pretended to shop
so i like that concept of using their own technology against them
i think our best projects are ones that are site specific and happen at a particular place for a reason
and one morning i was riding the subway
i had to make a transfer at the 53rd st. stop where there are these two giant escalators
and it 's a very depressing place to be in the morning it 's very crowded
so i decided to try and stage something that could make it as happy as possible for one morning
so this was in the winter of 2009 8 30 in the morning
it 's morning rush hour
it 's very cold outside
people are coming in from queens transferring from the e train to the 6 train
and they 're going up these giant escalators on their way to their jobs
thank you
so there 's a photograph that illustrates it a little bit better
he gave 2,000 high fives that day and he washed his hands before and afterward and did not get sick
and that was done also without permission although no one seemed to care
so i 'd say over the years one of the most common criticisms i see of improv everywhere left anonymously on youtube comments is these people have too much time on their hands
and you know not everybody 's going to like everything you do and i 've certainly developed a thick skin thanks to internet comments but that one 's always bothered me because we don 't have too much time on our hands
the participants at improv everywhere events have just as much leisure time as any other new yorkers they just occasionally choose to spend it in an unusual way
you know every saturday and sunday hundreds of thousands of people each fall gather in football stadiums to watch games
and i 've never seen anybody comment looking at a football game saying all those people in the stands they have too much time on their hands
and of course they don 't
it 's a perfectly wonderful way to spent a weekend afternoon watching a football game in a stadium
but i think it 's also a perfectly valid way to spend an afternoon freezing in place with 200 people in the grand central terminal or dressing up like a ghostbuster and running through the new york public library
or listening to the same mp3 as 3,000 other people and dancing silently in a park or bursting into song in a grocery store as part of a spontaneous musical or diving into the ocean in coney island wearing formal attire
you know as kids we 're taught to play
and we 're never given a reason why we should play
it 's just acceptable that play is a good thing
and i think that 's sort of the point of improv everywhere
it 's that there is no point and that there doesn 't have to be a point
we don 't need a reason
as long as it 's fun and it seems like it 's going to be a funny idea and it seems like the people who witness it will also have a fun time then that 's enough for us
and i think as adults we need to learn that there 's no right or wrong way to play
thank you very much
in my previous life i was an artist
i still paint i love art
i love the joy that color can give to our lives and to our communities and i try to bring something of the artist in me in my politics and i see part of my job today the reason for being here not just to campaign for my party but for politics and the role it can play for the better in our lives
for 11 years i was mayor of tirana our capital
we faced many challenges
art was part of the answer and my name in the very beginning was linked with two things demolition of illegal constructions in order to get public space back and use of colors in order to revive the hope that had been lost in my city
but this use of colors was not just an artistic act
rather it was a form of political action in a context when the city budget i had available after being elected amounted to zero comma something
when we painted the first building by splashing a radiant orange on the somber gray of a facade something unimaginable happened
there was a traffic jam and a crowd of people gathered as if it were the location of some spectacular accident or the sudden sighting of a visiting pop star
the french e.u. official in charge of the funding rushed to block the painting
he screeched that he would block the financing
but why i asked him
because the colors you have ordered do not meet european standards he replied
well i told him the surroundings do not meet european standards even though this is not what we want but we will choose the colors ourselves because this is exactly what we want
and if you do not let us continue with our work i will hold a press conference here right now right in this road and we will tell people that you look to me just like the censors of the socialist realism era
then he was kind of troubled and asked me for a compromise
but i told him no i 'm sorry compromise in colors is gray and we have enough gray to last us a lifetime
so it 's time for change
the rehabilitation of public spaces revived the feeling of belonging to a city that people lost
the pride of people about their own place of living and there were feelings that had been buried deep for years under the fury of the illegal barbaric constructions that sprang up in the public space
and when colors came out everywhere a mood of change started transforming the spirit of people
big noise raised up what is this what is happening
what are colors doing to us
and we made a poll the most fascinating poll i 've seen in my life
we asked people do you want this action and to have buildings painted like that
and then the second question was do you want it to stop or do you want it to continue
to the first question 63 percent of people said yes we like it
thirty-seven said no we don 't like it
but to the second question half of them that didn 't like it they wanted it to continue
so we noticed change
people started to drop less litter in the streets for example started to pay taxes started to feel something they had forgotten and beauty was acting as a guardsman where municipal police or the state itself were missing
one day i remember walking along a street that had just been colored and where we were in the process of planting trees when i saw a shopkeeper and his wife putting a glass facade to their shop
they had thrown the old shutter in the garbage collection place
why did you throw away the shutters i asked him
well because the street is safer now they answered
safer why they have posted more policemen here
come on man what policemen
you can see it for yourself there are colors streetlights new pavement with no potholes trees so it 's beautiful it 's safe
and indeed it was beauty that was giving people this feeling of being protected
and this was not a misplaced feeling
crime did fall
the freedom that was won in 1990 brought about a state of anarchy in the city while the barbarism of the 90s brought about a loss of hope for the city
the paint on the walls did not feed children nor did it tend the sick or educate the ignorant but it gave hope and light and helped to make people see there could be a different way of doing things a different spirit a different feel to our lives and that if we brought the same energy and hope to our politics we could build a better life for each other and for our country
we removed 123,000 tons of concrete only from the riverbanks
we demolished more than 5,000 illegal buildings all over the city up to eight stories high the tallest of them
we planted 55,000 trees and bushes in the streets
we established a green tax and then everybody accepted it and all businessmen paid it regularly
by means of open competitions we managed to recruit in our administration many young people and we thus managed to build a de-politicized public institution where men and women were equally represented
international organizations have invested a lot in albania during these 20 years not all of it well spent
when i told the world bank directors that i wanted them to finance a project to build a model reception hall for citizens precisely in order to fight endemic daily corruption they did not understand me
but people were waiting in long queues under sun and under rain in order to get a certificate or just a simple answer from two tiny windows of two metal kiosks
they were paying in order to skip the queue the long queue
the reply to their requests was met by a voice coming from this dark hole and on the other hand a mysterious hand coming out to take their documents while searching through old documents for the bribe
we could change the invisible clerks within the kiosks every week but we could not change this corrupt practice
i 'm convinced i told a german official with the world bank that it would be impossible for them to be bribed if they worked in germany in a german administration just as i am convinced that if you put german officials from the german administration in those holes they would be bribed just the same
it 's not about genes
it 's not about some being with a high conscience and some others having not a conscience
it 's about system it 's about organization
it 's also about environment and respect
we removed the kiosks
we built the bright new reception hall that made people tirana citizens think they had traveled abroad when they entered to make their requests
we created an online system of control and so speeded up all the processes
we put the citizen first and not the clerks
the corruption in the state administration of countries like albania it 's not up to me to say also like greece can be fought only by modernization
reinventing the government by reinventing politics itself is the answer and not reinventing people based on a ready-made formula that the developed world often tries in vain to impose to people like us
things have come to this point because politicians in general but especially in our countries let 's face it think people are stupid
they take it for granted that come what may people have to follow them while politics more and more fails to offer answers for their public concerns or the exigencies of the common people
politics has come to resemble a cynical team game played by politicians while the public has been pushed aside as if sitting on the seats of a stadium in which passion for politics is gradually making room for blindness and desperation
seen from those stairs all politicians today seem the same and politics has come to resemble a sport that inspires more aggressiveness and pessimism than social cohesion and the desire for civic protaganism
barack obama won because he mobilized people as never before through the use of social networks
he did not know each and every one of them but with an admirable ingenuity he managed to transform them into activists by giving them all the possibility to hold in their hands the arguments and the instruments that each would need to campaign in his name by making his own campaign
i tweet i love it
i love it because it lets me get the message out but it also lets people get their messages to me
this is politics not from top down but from the bottom up and sideways and allowing everybody 's voice to be heard is exactly what we need
politics is not just about leaders
it 's not just about politicians and laws
it is about how people think how they view the world around them how they use their time and their energy
when people say all politicians are the same ask yourself if obama was the same as bush if françois hollande is the same as sarkozy
they are not they are human beings with different views and different visions for the world
when people say nothing can change just stop and think what the world was like 10 20 50 100 years ago
our world is defined by the pace of change
we can all change the world
i gave you a very small example of how one thing the use of color can make change happen
i want to make more change as prime minister of my country but every single one of you can make change happen if you want to
president roosevelt he said believe you can and you are halfway there
efharisto and kalinihta

for emotions we should not move quickly to the desert
so first a small housekeeping announcement please switch off your proper english check programs installed in your brain
so welcome to the golden desert indian desert
it receives the least rainfall in the country lowest rainfall
if you are well-versed with inches nine inches centimeters 16 [ centimeters ]
the groundwater is 300 feet deep 100 meters
and in most parts it is saline not fit for drinking
so you can 't install hand pumps or dig wells though there is no electricity in most of the villages
but suppose you use the green technology solar pumps they are of no use in this area
so welcome to the golden desert
clouds seldom visit this area
but we find 40 different names of clouds in this dialect used here
there are a number of techniques to harvest rain
this is a new work it 's a new program
but for the desert society this is no program this is their life
and they harvest rain in many ways
so this is the first device they use in harvesting rain
it 's called kunds somewhere it is called [ unclear ]
and you can notice they have created a kind of false catchment
the desert is there sand dunes some small field
and this is all big raised platform
you can notice the small holes the water will fall on this catchment and there is a slope
sometimes our engineers and architects do not care about slopes in bathrooms but here they will care properly
and the water will go where it should go
and then it is 40 feet deep
the waterproofing is done perfectly better than our city contractors because not a single drop should go waste in this
they collect 100 thousand liters in one season
and this is pure drinking water
below the surface there is hard saline water
but now you can have this for year round
it 's two houses
we often use a term called bylaws
because we are used to get written things
but here it is unwritten by law
and people made their house and the water storage tanks
these raised up platforms just like this stage
in fact they go 15 feet deep and collect rain water from roof there is a small pipe and from their courtyard
it can also harvest something like 25,000 in a good monsoon
another big one this is of course out of the hardcore desert area
this is near jaipur this is called the jaigarh fort
and it can collect six million gallons of rainwater in one season
the age is 400 years
so since 400 years it has been giving you almost six million gallons of water per season
you can calculate the price of that water
it draws water from 15 kilometers of canals
you can see a modern road hardly 50 years old
it can break sometimes
but this 400 year old canal which draws water it is maintained for so many generations
of course if you want to go inside the two doors are locked
but they can be opened for ted people
and we request them
you can see person coming up with two canisters of water
and the water level these are not empty canisters water level is right up to this
it can envy many municipalities the color the taste the purity of this water
and this is what they call zero b type of water because it comes from the clouds pure distilled water
we stop for a quick commercial break and then we come back to the traditional systems
the government thought that this is a very backward area and we should bring a multi-million dollar project to bring water from the himalayas
that 's why i said that this is a commercial break
but we will come back once again to the traditional thing
so water from 300 400 kilometers away soon it become like this
in many portions water hyacinth covered these big canals like anything
of course there are some areas where water is reaching i 'm not saying that it is not reaching at all
but the tail end the jaisalmer area you will notice in bikaner things like this where the water hyacinth couldn 't grow the sand is flowing in these canals
the bonus is that you can find wildlife around it
we had full-page advertisements some 30 years 25 years ago when this canal came
they said that throw away your traditional systems these new cement tanks will supply you piped water
it 's a dream and it became a dream also
because soon the water was not able to reach these areas
and people started renovating their own structures
these are all traditional water structures which we won 't be able to explain in such a short time
but you can see that no woman is standing on those
and they are plaiting hair
jaisalmer this is heart of desert
this town was established 800 years ago
i 'm not sure by that time bombay was there or delhi was there or chennai was there or bangalore was there
so this was the terminal point for silk route
well connected 800 years ago through europe
none of us were able to go to europe but jaisalmer was well connected to it
and this is the 16 centimeter area
such a limited rainfall and highest colorful life flourished in these areas
you won 't find water in this slide
but it is invisible
somewhere a stream or a rivulet is running through here
or if you want to paint you can paint it blue throughout because every roof which you see in this picture collects rainwater drops and deposit in the rooms
but apart from this system they designed 52 beautiful water bodies around this town
and what we call private public partnership you can add estate also
so estate public and private entrepreneurs work together to build this beautiful water body
and it 's a kind of water body for all seasons
you will admire it just behold the beauty throughout the year
whether water level goes up or down the beauty is there throughout
another water body dried up of course during the summer period but you can see how the traditional society combines engineering with aesthetics with the heart
these statues marvelous statues gives you an idea of water table
when this rain comes and the water starts filling this tank it will submerge these beautiful statues in what we call in english today mass communication
this was for mass communication
everybody in the town will know that this elephant has drowned so water will be there for seven months or nine months or 12 months
and then they will come and worship this pond pay respect their gratitude
another small water body called the [ unclear ]
it is difficult to translate in english especially in my english
but the nearest would be glory a reputation
the reputation in desert of this small water body is that it never dries up
in severe drought periods nobody has seen this water body getting dried up
and perhaps they knew the future also
it was designed some 150 years ago
but perhaps they knew that on sixth november 2009 there will be a ted green and blue session so they painted it like this
dry water body children are standing on a very difficult device to explain
this is called kund we have in english surface water and ground water
but this is not ground water
you can draw ground water from any well
but this is no ordinary well
it squeeze the moisture hidden in the sand
and they have dubbed this water as the third one called [ unclear ]
and there is a gypsum belt running below it
and it was deposited by the great mother earth some three million years ago
and where we have this gypsum strip they can harvest this water
this is the same dry water body
now you don 't find any kund they are all submerged
but when the water goes down they will be able to draw water from those structures throughout the year
this year they have received only six centimeters
six centimeter of rainfall and they can telephone you that if you find any water problem in your city delhi bombay bangalore mysore please come to our area of six centimeters we can give you water
how they maintain them
there are three things concept planning making the actual thing and also maintaining them
it is a structure for maintain for centuries by generations without any department without any funding so the secret is [ unclear ] respect
your own thing not personal property my property every time
so these stone pillars will remind you that you are entering into a water body area
don 't spit don 't do anything wrong so that the clean water can be collected
another pillar stone pillar on your right side
if you climb these three six steps you will find something very nice
this was done in 11th century
and you have to go further down
they say that a picture is worth a thousand words so we can say a thousand words right now an another thousand words
if the water table goes down you will find new stairs
if it comes up some of them will be submerged
so throughout the year this beautiful system will give you some pleasure
three sides such steps on the fourth side there is a four-story building where you can organize such ted conferences anytime
excuse me who built these structures
they are in front of you
the best civil engineers we had the best planners the best architects
we can say that because of them because of their forefathers india could get the first engineering college in 1847
there were no english medium schools at that time even no hindi schools [ unclear ] schools
but such people compelled to the east india company which came here for business a very dirty kind of business ...
but not to create the engineering colleges
but because of them first engineering college was created in a small village not in the town
the last point we all know in our primary schools that that camel is a ship of desert
so you can find through your jeep a camel and a cart
this tire comes from the airplane
so look at the beauty from the desert society who can harvest rainwater and also create something through a tire from a jet plane and used in a camel cart
last picture it 's a tattoo 2,000-years-old tattoo
they were using it on their body
tattoo was at one time a kind of a blacklisted or con thing but now it is in thing
you can copy this tattoo i have some posters of this
the center of life is water
these are the beautiful waves
these are the beautiful stairs which we just saw in one of the slides
these are the trees
and these are the flowers which add fragrance to our lives
so this is the message of desert
thank you very much
so first of all i wish i had your eloquence truly in any language
these artifacts and designs are inspiring
do you believe that they can be used elsewhere that the world can learn from this
or is this just right for this place
anupam mishra no the basic idea is to utilize water that falls on our area
so the ponds the open bodies are everywhere right from sri lanka to kashmir and in other parts also
and these [ unclear ] which stored water there are two type of things
one recharge and one stores
so it depends on the terrain
but kund which uses the gypsum belt for that you have to go back to your calendar three million years ago
if it is there it can be done right now
otherwise it can 't be done
thank you so much
can i ask you to please recall a time when you really loved something a movie an album a song or a book and you recommended it wholeheartedly to someone you also really liked and you anticipated that reaction you waited for it and it came back and the person hated it
so by way of introduction that is the exact same state in which i spent every working day of the last six years
i teach high school math
i sell a product to a market that doesn 't want it but is forced by law to buy it
i mean it 's just a losing proposition
so there 's a useful stereotype about students that i see a useful stereotype about you all
i could give you guys an algebra-two final exam and i would expect no higher than a 25 percent pass rate
and both of these facts say less about you or my students than they do about what we call math education in the u.s. today
to start with i 'd like to break math down into two categories
one is computation this is the stuff you 've forgotten
for example factoring quadratics with leading coefficients greater than one
this stuff is also really easy to relearn provided you have a really strong grounding in reasoning math reasoning we 'll call it the application of math processes to the world around us this is hard to teach
this is what we would love students to retain even if they don 't go into mathematical fields
this is also something that the way we teach it in the u.s.
all but ensures they won 't retain it
so i 'd like to talk about why that is why that 's such a calamity for society what we can do about it and to close with why this is an amazing time to be a math teacher
so first five symptoms that you 're doing math reasoning wrong in your classroom
one is a lack of initiative your students don 't self-start
you finish your lecture block and immediately you have five hands going up asking you to re-explain the entire thing at their desks
students lack perseverance
they lack retention you find yourself re-explaining concepts three months later wholesale
there 's an aversion to word problems which describes 99 percent of my students
and then the other one percent is eagerly looking for the formula to apply in that situation
this is really destructive
david milch creator of deadwood and other amazing tv shows has a really good description for this
he swore off creating contemporary drama shows set in the present day because he saw that when people fill their mind with four hours a day of for example two and a half men no disrespect it shapes the neural pathways he said in such a way that they expect simple problems
he called it an impatience with irresolution
you 're impatient with things that don 't resolve quickly
you expect sitcom-sized problems that wrap up in 22 minutes three commercial breaks and a laugh track
and i 'll put it to all of you what you already know that no problem worth solving is that simple
i am very concerned about this because i 'm going to retire in a world that my students will run
i 'm doing bad things to my own future and well-being when i teach this way
i 'm here to tell you that the way our textbooks particularly mass-adopted textbooks teach math reasoning and patient problem solving it 's functionally equivalent to turning on two and a half men and calling it a day
in all seriousness here 's an example from a physics textbook
it applies equally to math
notice first of all here that you have exactly three pieces of information there each of which will figure into a formula somewhere eventually which the student will then compute
i believe in real life
and ask yourself what problem have you solved ever that was worth solving where you knew all of the given information in advance where you didn 't have a surplus of information and you had to filter it out or you didn 't have sufficient information and had to go find some
i 'm sure we all agree that no problem worth solving is like that
and the textbook i think knows how it 's hamstringing students because watch this this is the practice problem set
when it comes time to do the actual problem set we have problems like this right here where we 're just swapping out numbers and tweaking the context a little bit
and if the student still doesn 't recognize the stamp this was molded from it helpfully explains to you what sample problem you can return to to find the formula
you could literally i mean this pass this particular unit without knowing any physics just knowing how to decode a textbook that 's a shame
so i can diagnose the problem a little more specifically in math
here 's a really cool problem i like this
it 's about defining steepness and slope using a ski lift
but what you have here is actually four separate layers and i 'm curious which of you can see the four separate layers and particularly how when they 're compressed together and presented to the student all at once how that creates this impatient problem solving
i 'll define them here you have the visual
you also have the mathematical structure talking about grids measurements labels points axes that sort of thing
you have substeps which all lead to what we really want to talk about which section is the steepest
so i hope you can see
i really hope you can see how what we 're doing here is taking a compelling question a compelling answer but we 're paving a smooth straight path from one to the other and congratulating our students for how well they can step over the small cracks in the way
that 's all we 're doing here
so i want to put to you that if we can separate these in a different way and build them up with students we can have everything we 're looking for in terms of patient problem solving
so right here i start with the visual and i immediately ask the question which section is the steepest
and this starts conversation because the visual is created in such a way where you can defend two answers
so you get people arguing against each other friend versus friend in pairs journaling whatever
and then eventually we realize it 's getting annoying to talk about the skier in the lower left-hand side of the screen or the skier just above the mid line
and we realize how great would it be if we just had some a b c and d labels to talk about them more easily
and then as we start to define what does steepness mean we realize it would be nice to have some measurements to really narrow it down specifically what that means
and then and only then we throw down that mathematical structure
the math serves the conversation the conversation doesn 't serve the math
and at that point i 'll put it to you that nine out of 10 classes are good to go on the whole slope steepness thing
but if you need to your students can then develop those substeps together
do you guys see how this right here compared to that which one creates that patient problem solving that math reasoning
it 's been obvious in my practice to me
and i 'll yield the floor here for a second to einstein who i believe has paid his dues
he talked about the formulation of a problem being so incredibly important and yet in my practice in the u.s. here we just give problems to students we don 't involve them in the formulation of the problem
so 90 percent of what i do with my five hours of prep time per week is to take fairly compelling elements of problems like this from my textbook and rebuild them in a way that supports math reasoning and patient problem solving
and here 's how it works
i like this question it 's about a water tank
the question is how long will it take you to fill it up
first things first we eliminate all the substeps
students have to develop those they have to formulate those
and then notice that all the information written on there is stuff you 'll need
none of it 's a distractor so we lose that
students need to decide all right well does the height matter does the side of it matter
does the color of the valve matter what matters here
such an underrepresented question in math curriculum
so now we have a water tank
how long will it take you to fill it up and that 's it
and because this is the 21st century and we would love to talk about the real world on its own terms not in terms of line art or clip art that you so often see in textbooks we go out and we take a picture of it
so now we have the real deal
how long will it take it to fill it up
and then even better is we take a video a video of someone filling it up
and it 's filling up slowly agonizingly slowly
it 's tedious
students are looking at their watches rolling their eyes and they 're all wondering at some point or another man how long is it going to take to fill up
that 's how you know you 've baited the hook right
and that question off this right here is really fun for me because like the intro i teach kids because of my inexperience i teach the kids that are the most remedial all right
and i 've got kids who will not join a conversation about math because someone else has the formula someone else knows how to work the formula better than me so i won 't talk about it
but here every student is on a level playing field of intuition
everyone 's filled something up with water before so i get kids answering the question how long will it take
i 've got kids who are mathematically and conversationally intimidated joining the conversation
we put names on the board attach them to guesses and kids have bought in here
and then we follow the process i 've described
and the best part here or one of the better parts is that we don 't get our answer from the answer key in the back of the teacher 's edition
we instead just watch the end of the movie
and that 's terrifying because the theoretical models that always work out in the answer key in the back of a teacher 's edition that 's great but it 's scary to talk about sources of error when the theoretical does not match up with the practical
but those conversations have been so valuable among the most valuable
so i 'm here to report some really fun games with students who come pre-installed with these viruses day one of the class
these are the kids who now one semester in i can put something on the board totally new totally foreign and they 'll have a conversation about it for three or four minutes more than they would have at the start of the year which is just so fun
we 're no longer averse to word problems because we 've redefined what a word problem is
we 're no longer intimidated by math because we 're slowly redefining what math is
this has been a lot of fun
i encourage math teachers i talk to to use multimedia because it brings the real world into your classroom in high resolution and full color to encourage student intuition for that level playing field to ask the shortest question you possibly can and let those more specific questions come out in conversation to let students build the problem because einstein said so and to finally in total just be less helpful because the textbook is helping you in all the wrong ways it 's buying you out of your obligation for patient problem solving and math reasoning to be less helpful
and why this is an amazing time to be a math teacher right now is because we have the tools to create this high-quality curriculum in our front pocket
it 's ubiquitous and fairly cheap and the tools to distribute it freely under open licenses has also never been cheaper or more ubiquitous
i put a video series on my blog not so long ago and it got 6,000 views in two weeks
i get emails still from teachers in countries i 've never visited saying wow yeah we had a good conversation about that
oh and by the way here 's how i made your stuff better which wow
i put this problem on my blog recently in a grocery store which line do you get into the one that has one cart and 19 items or the line with four carts and three five two and one items
and the linear modeling involved in that was some good stuff for my classroom but it eventually got me on good morning america a few weeks later which is just bizarre right
and from all of this i can only conclude that people not just students are really hungry for this
math makes sense of the world
math is the vocabulary for your own intuition
so i just really encourage you whatever your stake is in education whether you 're a student parent teacher policy maker whatever insist on better math curriculum
we need more patient problem solvers thank you

have you ever asked yourselves why it is that companies the really cool companies the innovative ones the creative new economy-type companies apple google facebook are coming out of one particular country the united states of america
usually when i say this someone says spotify
that 's europe but yeah
it has not had the impact that these other companies have had
now what i do is i 'm an economist and i actually study the relationship between innovation and economic growth at the level of the company the industry and the nation and i work with policymakers worldwide especially in the european commission but recently also in interesting places like china and i can tell you that that question is on the tip of all of their tongues where are the european googles
what is the secret behind the silicon valley growth model which they understand is different from this old economy growth model
and what is interesting is that often even if we 're in the 21st century we kind of come down in the end to these ideas of market versus state
it 's talked about in these modern ways but the idea is that somehow behind places like silicon valley the secret have been different types of market-making mechanisms the private initiative whether this be about a dynamic venture capital sector that 's actually able to provide that high-risk finance to these innovative companies the gazelles as we often call them which traditional banks are scared of or different types of really successful commercialization policies which actually allow these companies to bring these great inventions their products to the market and actually get over this really scary death valley period in which many companies instead fail
but what really interests me especially nowadays and because of what 's happening politically around the world is the language that 's used the narrative the discourse the images the actual words
so we often are presented with the kind of words like that the private sector is also much more innovative because it 's able to think out of the box
they are more dynamic
think of steve jobs really inspirational speech to the 2005 graduating class at stanford where he said to be innovative you 've got to stay hungry stay foolish
right so these guys are kind of the hungry and foolish and colorful guys right
and in places like europe it might be more equitable we might even be a bit better dressed and eat better than the u.s. but the problem is this damn public sector
it 's a bit too big and it hasn 't actually allowed these things like dynamic venture capital and commercialization to actually be able to really be as fruitful as it could
and even really respectable newspapers some that i 'm actually subscribed to the words they use are you know the state as this leviathan right
this monster with big tentacles
they 're very explicit in these editorials
they say you know the state it 's necessary to fix these little market failures when you have public goods or different types of negative externalities like pollution but you know what what is the next big revolution going to be after the internet
we all hope it might be something green or all of this nanotech stuff and in order for that stuff to happen they say this was a special issue on the next industrial revolution they say the state just stick to the basics right
fund the infrastructure fund the schools
even fund the basic research because this is popularly recognized in fact as a big public good which private companies don 't want to invest in do that but you know what
leave the rest to the revolutionaries
those colorful out-of-the-box kind of thinkers
they 're often called garage tinkerers because some of them actually did some things in garages even though that 's partly a myth
and so what i want to do with you in oh god only 10 minutes is to really think again this juxtaposition because it actually has massive massive implications beyond innovation policy which just happens to be the area that i often talk with with policymakers
it has huge implications even with this whole notion that we have on where when and why we should actually be cutting back on public spending and different types of public services which of course as we know are increasingly being outsourced because of this juxtaposition
right i mean the reason that we need to maybe have free schools or charter schools is in order to make them more innovative without being emburdened by this heavy hand of the state curriculum or something
so these kind of words are constantly these juxtapositions come up everywhere not just with innovation policy
and so to think again there 's no reason that you should believe me so just think of some of the smartest revolutionary things that you have in your pockets and do not turn it on but you might want to take it out your iphone
ask who actually funded the really cool revolutionary thinking-out-of-the-box things in the iphone
what actually makes your phone a smartphone basically instead of a stupid phone
so the internet which you can surf the web anywhere you are in the world gps where you can actually know where you are anywhere in the world the touchscreen display which makes it also a really easy-to-use phone for anybody
these are the very smart revolutionary bits about the iphone and they 're all government-funded
and the point is that the internet was funded by darpa u.s. department of defense
gps was funded by the military 's navstar program
even siri was actually funded by darpa
the touchscreen display was funded by two public grants by the cia and the nsf to two public university researchers at the university of delaware
now you might be thinking well she 's just said the word defense and military an awful lot but what 's really interesting is that this is actually true in sector after sector and department after department
so the pharmaceutical industry which i am personally very interested in because i 've actually had the fortune to study it in quite some depth is wonderful to be asking this question about the revolutionary versus non-revolutionary bits because each and every medicine can actually be divided up on whether it really is revolutionary or incremental
so the new molecular entities with priority rating are the revolutionary new drugs whereas the slight variations of existing drugs viagra different color different dosage are the less revolutionary ones
and it turns out that a full 75 percent of the new molecular entities with priority rating are actually funded in boring kafkian public sector labs
this doesn 't mean that big pharma is not spending on innovation
they do they spend on the marketing part
they spend on the d part of r & amp d .
they spend an awful lot on buying back their stock which is quite problematic
in fact companies like pfizer and amgen recently have spent more money in buying back their shares to boost their stock price than on r & amp d but that 's a whole different ted talk which one day i 'd be fascinated to tell you about
now what 's interesting in all of this is the state in all these examples was doing so much more than just fixing market failures
it was actually shaping and creating markets
it was funding not only the basic research which again is a typical public good but even the applied research
it was even god forbid being a venture capitalist
so these sbir and sdtr programs which give small companies early-stage finance have not only been extremely important compared to private venture capital but also have become increasingly important
why because as many of us know v.c. is actually quite short-term
they want their returns in three to five years
innovation takes a much longer time than that 15 to 20 years
and so this whole notion i mean this is the point right
who 's actually funding the hard stuff
of course it 's not just the state
the private sector does a lot
but the narrative that we 've always been told is the state is important for the basics but not really providing that sort of high-risk revolutionary thinking out of the box
in all these sectors from funding the internet to doing the spending but also the envisioning the strategic vision for these investments it was actually coming within the state
the nanotechnology sector is actually fascinating to study this because the word itself nanotechnology came from within government
and so there 's huge implications of this
first of all of course i 'm not someone this old-fashioned person market versus state
what we all know in dynamic capitalism is that what we actually need are public-private partnerships
but the point is by constantly depicting the state part as necessary but actually pffff a bit boring and often a bit dangerous kind of leviathan i think we 've actually really stunted the possibility to build these public-private partnerships in a really dynamic way
even the words that we often use to justify the p part the public part well they 're both p 's with public-private partnerships is in terms of de-risking
what the public sector did in all these examples i just gave you and there 's many more which myself and other colleagues have been looking at is doing much more than de-risking
it 's kind of been taking on that risk bring it on
it 's actually been the one thinking out of the box
but also i 'm sure you all have had experience with local regional national governments and you 're kind of like you know what that kafkian bureaucrat i 've met him
that whole juxtaposition thing it 's kind of there
well there 's a self-fulfilling prophecy
by talking about the state as kind of irrelevant boring it 's sometimes that we actually create those organizations in that way
so what we have to actually do is build these entrepreneurial state organizations
darpa that funded the internet and siri actually thought really hard about this how to welcome failure because you will fail
you will fail when you innovative
one out of 10 experiments has any success
and the v.c. guys know this and they 're able to actually fund the other losses from that one success
and this brings me actually probably to the biggest implication and this has huge implications beyond innovation
if the state is more than just a market fixer if it actually is a market shaper and in doing that has had to take on this massive risk what happened to the reward
we all know if you 've ever taken a finance course the first thing you 're taught is sort of the risk-reward relationship and so some people are foolish enough or probably smart enough if they have time to wait to actually invest in stocks because they 're higher risk which over time will make a greater reward than bonds that whole risk-reward thing
well where 's the reward for the state of having taken on these massive risks and actually been foolish enough to have done the internet
the internet was crazy
it really was i mean the probability of failure was massive
you had to be completely nuts to do it and luckily they were
now we don 't even get to this question about rewards unless you actually depict the state as this risk-taker
and the problem is that economists often think well there is a reward back to the state it 's tax
you know the companies will pay tax the jobs they create will create growth so people who get those jobs and their incomes rise will come back to the state through the tax mechanism
well unfortunately that 's not true
okay it 's not true because many of the jobs that are created go abroad
globalization and that 's fine we shouldn 't be nationalistic
let the jobs go where they have to go perhaps
i mean one can take a position on that
but also these companies that have actually had this massive benefit from the state apple 's a great example
they even got the first well not the first but 500,000 dollars actually went to apple the company through this sbic program which predated the sbir program as well as as i said before all the technologies behind the iphone
and yet we know they legally as many other companies pay very little tax back
so what we really need to actually rethink is should there perhaps be a return-generating mechanism that 's much more direct than tax why not
it could happen perhaps through equity
this by the way in the countries that are actually thinking about this strategically countries like finland in scandinavia but also in china and brazil they 're retaining equity in these investments
sitra funded nokia kept equity made a lot of money it 's a public funding agency in finland which then funded the next round of nokias
the brazilian development bank which is providing huge amounts of funds today to clean technology they just announced a 56 billion program for the future on this is retaining equity in these investments
so to put it provocatively had the u.s. government thought about this and maybe just brought back just something called an innovation fund you can bet that you know if even just .05 percent of the profits from what the internet produced had come back to that innovation fund there would be so much more money to spend today on green technology
instead many of the state budgets which in theory are trying to do that are being constrained
but perhaps even more important we heard before about the one percent the 99 percent
if the state is thought about in this more strategic way as one of the lead players in the value creation mechanism because that 's what we 're talking about right
who are the different players in creating value in the economy and is the state 's role has it been sort of dismissed as being a backseat player
if we can actually have a broader theory of value creation and allow us to actually admit what the state has been doing and reap something back it might just be that in the next round and i hope that we all hope that the next big revolution will in fact be green that that period of growth will not only be smart innovation-led not only green but also more inclusive so that the public schools in places like silicon valley can actually also benefit from that growth because they have not
thank you
there are more chinese restaurants in this country than mcdonald 's burger king kentucky fried chicken and wendy 's combined 40,000 actually
chinese restaurants have played an important role in american history as a matter of fact
the cuban missile crisis was resolved in a chinese restaurant called yenching palace in washington d.c. which unfortunately is closed now and about to be turned into walgreen 's
and the house that john wilkes booth planned the assassination of abraham lincoln is actually also now a chinese restaurant called wok n roll on h street in washington
and it 's not completely gratuitous because wok and roll chinese food and japanese foods so it kind of works out
and americans love their chinese food so much they 've actually brought it into space
nasa for example serves thermal-stabilized sweet-and-sour pork on its shuttle menu for its astronauts
so let me present the question to you if our benchmark for americanness is apple pie you should ask yourself how often do you eat apple pie versus how often do you eat chinese food right
and if you think about it a lot of the foods that you think of or we think of or americans think of as chinese food are barely recognizable to chinese for example beef with broccoli egg rolls general tso 's chicken fortune cookies chop suey the take-out boxes
for example i took a whole bunch of fortune cookies back to china gave them to chinese to see how they would react
what is this
should i try it
try it
what is it called
fortune cookie
there 's a piece of paper inside
what is this
you 've won a prize
what is this
it 's a fortune
tasty
so where are they from
the short answer is actually they 're from japan
and in kyoto outside there are still small family-run bakeries that make fortune cookies as they did over 100 years ago 30 years before fortune cookies were introduced in the united states
if you see them side by side there 's yellow and brown
theirs are actually flavored with miso and sesame paste so they 're not as sweet as our version
so how did they get to the united states
well the short answer is the japanese immigrants came over and a bunch of the bakers introduced them including at least one in los angeles and one here in san francisco called benkyo-do which is on the corner of sutter and buchanan
they back then actually made fortune cookies using very much the similar kind of irons that we saw back in kyoto
so the interesting question is how do you go from fortune cookies being something that is japanese to being something that is chinese
well the short answer is we locked up all the japanese during world war ii including those that made fortune cookies so that 's the time when the chinese moved in kind of saw a market opportunity and took over
so fortune cookies invented by the japanese popularized by the chinese but ultimately consumed by americans
they are more american than anything else
another one of my favorite dishes general tso 's chicken which by the way in the us naval academy is called admiral tso 's chicken
i love this dish
the original name in my book was actually called the long march of general tso and he has marched very far indeed because he is sweet he is fried and he is chicken all things that americans love
he has marched so far actually that the chef who originally invented the dish doesn 't recognize it he 's kind of horrified
he 's in taiwan right now
he 's retired deaf and plays a lot of mahjong
so he after this i showed him he got up and he 's like mominqimiao which means this is all nonsense and goes back to play his mahjong game during the afternoon
so another dish one of my favorites beef with broccoli
broccoli is not a chinese vegetable in fact it is originally an italian vegetable
it was introduced into the united states in the 1800s but became popularized in the 1920s and the 1930s
in fact the chinese had their own version of broccoli which is called chinese broccoli but right now what they 've now discovered american broccoli and are importing it as a sort of exotic delicacy
i guarantee you general tso never saw a stalk of broccoli in his life and indeed that actually was a picture of general tso
i went to his home town
this is a billboard that says welcome to the birthplace of general tso
and i went looking for chicken
finally found a cow and did find chicken
believe it or not these guys were actually crossing the road
and i actually found a whole bunch of general tso 's relatives who are still in the little town
this guy is now five generations removed from the general this guy is about seven
showed them all the pictures of general tso chicken that i showed you and they 're like we don 't know this dish
and then they 're like is this chinese food
because it doesn 't look like chinese food to them
but they weren 't kind of surprised i traveled around the world to visit them because in their eyes he is after all a famous qing dynasty military hero
he played an important role in the taiping rebellion which was a war started by a guy who thought he was the son of god and the baby brother of jesus christ
and caused the war that killed 20 million people still the deadliest civil war in the world to this day
so you know i realized when i was there general tso is kind of a lot like colonel sanders in america in that he 's known for chicken and not war
but in china this guy 's actually known for war and not chicken
but the granddaddy of all the chinese-american dishes we probably ought to talk about is chop suey which was introduced around the turn of the 20th century
and according to new york times in 1904 there was an outbreak of chinese restaurants all over town and the city has gone chop suey mad
so it took about 30 years before the americans realized that whoa chop suey is actually not known in china
and as this article points out the average native of any city in china knows nothing of chop suey
you know back then it was a way to show that you were sophisticated and cosmopolitan if you were a guy and you wanted to impress a girl you could take her out on a chop suey date
i like to say chop suey 's the biggest culinary joke that one culture has ever played on another because chop suey if you translate into chinese means tsap sui which if you translate back means odds and ends
so these people are going around china asking for chop suey which is sort of like a japanese guy coming here and saying i understand you have a very popular dish in your country called leftovers and it is particularly right
and not only that this dish is particularly popular after that holiday you call thanksgiving
so why why and where did chop suey come from
let 's go back to mid-1800s when the chinese first came to america
now back then the americans were not clamoring to eat chinese food
in fact they saw this people who landed at their shores as alien
these people weren 't eating dogs they were eating cats and they weren 't eating cats they were eating rats
in fact the new york times my esteemed employer in 1883 ran an article that asked do chinese eat rats
and not the most pc question to be asked today but if you kind of look at the popular imagery of the time not so outlandish
this is actually a real advertisement for rat poison from the late 1800s and if you see under the word clears very small it says they must go which refers not only to the rats but to the chinese in their midst because the way that the food was perceived was that these people who ate foods different from us must be different from us
and another way that you saw sort of this sort of this antipathy towards the chinese is through documents like this
this is actually in the library of congress it is a pamphlet published by samuel gompers hero of our american labor movement and it 's called some reason for chinese exclusion meat versus rice american manhood against asiatic coolieism which shall survive
and it basically made the argument that chinese men who ate rice would necessarily bring down the standard of living for american men who ate meat
and as a matter of fact then this is one of the reasons why we must exclude them from this country so with sentiments like these the chinese exclusion act was sort of passed between 1882 and 1902 the only time in american history when a group was specifically excluded for its national origin or ethnicity
so in a way because the chinese were attacked chop suey was created as a defense mechanism
now who came up with the idea of chop suey
there 's a lot of different mysteries a lot of different legends but of the ones that i 've found that i thought was most interesting is this article from 1904
a chinese guy named lem sen shows up in chinatown new york city and says i want you guys all to stop making chop suey because i am the original creator and sole proprietor of the dish known as chop suey
and the way that he tells it there was a guy there was a famous chinese diplomat that showed up and he was told to make a dish that looked very popular and could quote pass as chinese
and as he said we would never print this today but basically the american man has become very rich
lem sen who 's this guy i would have made this money too but i 've spent all this time looking for the american man who stole my recipe
now i 've come and found him and i want my recipe back and i want everyone to stop making chop suey or pay me for the right to do the same
so it was an early exercise of intellectual property rights
so the thing is this kind of idea of chinese-american food doesn 't exist only in america
in fact if you think about it chinese food is the most pervasive food on the planet served on all seven continents even antarctica because monday night is chinese food night at mcmurdo station which is the main scientific station in antarctica
so you see different varieties of chinese food
for example there is french chinese food where they serve salt and pepper frog legs
there is italian chinese food where they don 't have fortune cookies so they serve fried gelato
my downstairs neighbor alessandra was completely shocked when i told her dude fried gelato is not chinese
she 's like it 's not
but they serve it in all the chinese restaurants in italy
and even the brits have their own version
this is a dish called crispy shredded beef which has a lot of crisp a lot of shred and not a lot of beef
there is west indian chinese food there 's jamaican chinese food there is middle eastern chinese food there 's mauritian chinese food
this is a dish called magic bowl that i discovered
there 's indian chinese food korean chinese food japanese chinese food where they take the bao the little buns and they make them into pizza versions and they take and they like totally randomly they 'll take chinese noodle dishes and they 'll just ramen-ize them
this is like this is something that in the chinese version has no soup
so there 's peruvian chinese food which should not be mixed with mexican chinese food where they basically take things and make it look like fajitas
and then one thing they have things like risotto chop suey
my personal favorite of all the restaurants i 've encountered around the world was this one in brazil called kung food
so let 's take a step back and kind of understand what is to be appreciated in america
mcdonald 's has sort of garnered a lot of attention a lot of respect for basically standardizing the menu décor and dining experience in post-world war ii america
but you know what
they actually did so through a centralized headquarters out of illinois right
chinese restaurants have done largely the same thing i would argue with the menu and the décor even the restaurant name but without a centralized headquarters
so this actually became very clear to me with the march 30 2005 powerball drawing where you know they expected based on the number of ticket sales they had to have three or four second-place winners those are the people who match five or six powerball numbers
instead they had 110 and they were completely shocked
they looked all across the country and discovered it couldn 't necessarily be fraud because it happened you know in different states across different computer systems
so whatever it was it caused people to sort of behave in a mass synchronized way
so like ok maybe it had to do with the patterns on the little pieces of paper you know like it was a diamond or you know diagonal
it wasn 't that
it wasn 't that so they 're like ok let 's look at television so they looked at an episode of lost
now i don 't have a tv which makes me a freak but very productive and and this episode of lost i understand where the overweight guy has a lucky number which was not a lucky number which was how long they 'd been on the island but they looked and the numbers did not match
so they looked at the young and the restless and it wasn 't that either
so it wasn 't until the first guy shows up the next day and they ask him where did you get your number from
he 's like oh i got it from a fortune cookie
this actually is a slip that one of the winners had because the tennessee lottery security officials were like oh no like this can 't be true
but it was true and basically of those 110 people and 104 of them or so had gotten their number from the fortune cookie
yeah so i went and started looking
i went across the country looking for these restaurants where these people had gotten their fortune cookies from
you know there are a bunch of them including lee 's china in omaha which is actually run by koreans but that 's another point and a bunch of them named china buffet
so what 's interesting is that their stories were similar but they were different
it was lunch it was take-out it was sit-down it was buffet it was three weeks ago it was three months ago
but at some point all these people had a very similar experience that converged at a fortune cookie and at a chinese restaurant and all these chinese restaurants were serving fortune cookies which of course we know aren 't even chinese to begin with
so it 's kind of part of the phenomenon i called spontaneous self-organization right where like in ant colonies where little decisions made by on the micro-level actually have a big impact on the macro-level
so a good sort of contrast is chicken mcnuggets
mcdonald 's actually spent 10 years coming out with a chicken-like product
they did chicken pot pie they did fried chicken and then they finally introduced chicken mcnuggets
and the great innovation of chicken mcnuggets was not nuggetfying them because that 's kind of an easy concept but the trick behind chicken mcnuggets was they were able to remove the chicken from the bone in a cost-effective manner which is why it took so long for other people to copy them
it took 10 years and then within a couple of months it was such a hit they just introduced it and rolled it across the entire system of mcdonald 's in the country
in contrast we have general tso 's chicken which actually started in new york city in the early 1970s as i was also starting in the university in new york city in the early 1970s so ...
and this logo
so me general tso 's chicken and this logo are all karmacally related
but that dish also took about 10 years to spread across america from a random restaurant in new york city
someone 's like oh god it 's sweet it 's fried it 's chicken americans will love this
so what i like to say you know this being sort of bay area silicon valley is that we think of mcdonald 's as sort of the microsoft of the dining experiences
we can think of chinese restaurants perhaps as linux sort of an open source thing right where ideas from one person can be copied and propagated across the entire system that there can be specialized versions of chinese food you know depending on the region
for example you know in new orleans we have cajun chinese food where they serve sichuan alligator and sweet and sour crawfish right
and in philadelphia you have philadelphia cheesesteak roll which looks like an egg roll on the outside but a cheesesteak on the inside
i was really surprised to discover that not only in philadelphia but also in atlanta because what had happened was that a chinese family had moved from atlanta to sorry from philadelphia to atlanta and brought that with them
so the thing is our historical lore because of the way we like narratives are full of vast characters such as you know howard schultz of starbucks and ray kroc with mcdonald 's and asa chandler with coca-cola
but you know it 's very easy to overlook the smaller characters oops for example like lem sen who introduced chop suey chef peng who introduced general tso chicken and all the japanese bakers who introduced fortune cookies
so the point of my presentation is to make you think twice that those whose names are forgotten in history can often have had as much if not more impact on what we eat today
so thank you very much

what is bioenergy bioenergy is not ethanol
bioenergy isn 't global warming bioenergy is something which seems counterintuitive bioenergy is oil it 's gas it 's coal and part of building that bridge to the future to the point where we can actually see the oceans in a rational way or put up these geo-spatial orbits that will twirl or do microwaves or stuff is going to depend on how we understand bioenergy and manage it and to do that you really have to look first at agriculture
so we 've been planting stuff for 11,000 years and in the measure that we plant stuff what we learn from agriculture is you 've got to deal with pests you 've got to deal with all types of awful things you 've got to cultivate stuff in the measure that you learn how to use water to cultivate then you 're going to be able to spread beyond the nile
you 're going to be able to power stuff so irrigation makes a difference
irrigation starts to make you be allowed to plant stuff where you want it as opposed to where the rivers flood you start getting this organic agriculture you start putting machinery onto this stuff machinery with a whole bunch of water leads to very large-scale agriculture
you put together machines and water and you get landscapes that look like this and then you get sales that look like this it 's brute force so what you 've been doing in agriculture is you start out with something that 's a reasonably natural system you start taming that natural system you put a lot of force behind that natural system you put a whole bunch of pesticides and herbicides behind that natural system and you end up with systems that look like this
and it 's all brute force and that 's the way we 've been approaching energy so the lesson in agriculture is that you can actually change the system that 's based on brute force as you start merging that system and learning that system and actually applying biology and you move from a discipline of engineering you move from a discipline of chemistry into a discipline of biology and probably one of the most important human beings on the planet is this guy behind me
this is a guy called norman borlaug he won the nobel prize he 's got the congressional medal of honor he deserves all of this stuff and he deserves this stuff because he probably has fed more people than any other human being alive because he researched how to put biology behind seeds he did this in mexico the reason why india and china no longer have these massive famines is because norman borlaug taught them how to grow grains in a more efficient way and launched the green revolution that is something that a lot of people have criticized but of course those are people who don 't realize that china and india instead of having huge amounts of starving people are exporting grains
and the irony of this particular system is the place where he did the research which was mexico didn 't adopt this technology ignored this technology talked about why this technology should be thought about but not really applied
and mexico remains one of the largest grain importers on the planet because it doesn 't apply technology that was discovered in mexico and in fact hasn 't recognized this man to the point where there aren 't statues of this man all over mexico there are in china and india and the institute that this guy ran has now moved to india that is the difference between adopting technologies and discussing technologies
now it 's not just that this guy fed a huge amount of people in the world it 's that this is the net effect in terms of what technology does if you understand biology
what happened in agriculture well if you take agriculture over a century agriculture in about 1900 would have been recognizable to somebody planting a thousand years earlier yeah the plows look different the machines were tractors or stuff instead of mules but the farmer would have understood this is what the guy 's doing this is why he 's doing it this is where he 's going what really started to change in agriculture is when you started moving from this brute force engineering and chemistry into biology and that 's where you get your productivity increases and as you do that stuff here 's what happens to productivity
basically you go from 250 hours to produce 100 bushels to 40 to 15 to five agricultural labor productivity increased seven times 1950 to 2000 whereas the rest of the economy increased about 2.5 times this is an absolutely massive increase in how much is produced per person
the effect of this of course is it 's not just amber waves of grain it is mountains of stuff
and 50 percent of the eu budget is going to subsidize agriculture from mountains of stuff that people have overproduced
this would be a good outcome for energy and of course by now you 're probably saying to yourself self i thought i came to a talk about energy and here 's this guy talking about biology
so where 's the link between these two things
one of the ironies of this whole system is we 're discussing what to do about a system that we don 't understand we don 't even know what oil is we don 't know where oil comes from i mean literally it 's still a source of debate what this black river of stuff is and where it comes from the best assumption and one of the best guesses in this stuff is that this stuff comes out of this stuff that these things absorb sunlight rot under pressure for millions of years and you get these black rivers
now the interesting thing about that thesis if that thesis turns out to be true is that oil and all hydrocarbons turned out to be concentrated sunlight and if you think of bioenergy bioenergy isn 't ethanol bioenergy is taking the sun concentrating it in amoebas concentrating it in plants and maybe that 's why you get these rainbows
and as you 're looking at this system if hydrocarbons are concentrated sunlight then bioenergy works in a different way and we 've got to start thinking of oil and other hydrocarbons as part of these solar panels
maybe that 's one of the reasons why if you fly over west texas the types of wells that you 're beginning to see don 't look unlike those pictures of kansas and those irrigated plots
this is how you farm oil and as you think of farming oil and how oil has evolved we started with this brute force approach and then what did we learn then we learned we had to go bigger and then what 'd we learn then we have to go even bigger and we are getting really destructive as we 're going out and farming this bioenergy
these are the athabasca tar sands and there 's an enormous amount first of mining the largest trucks in the world are working here and then you 've got to pull out this black sludge which is basically oil that doesn 't flow it 's tied to the sand and then you 've got to use a lot of steam to separate it which only works at today 's oil prices
coal coal turns out to be virtually the same stuff it is probably plants except that these have been burned and crushed under pressure
so you take something like this you burn it you put it under pressure and likely as not you get this although again i stress we don 't know
which is curious as we debate all this stuff but as you think of coal this is what burned wheat kernels look like not entirely unlike coal
and of course coalmines are very dangerous places because in some of these coalmines you get gas when that gas blows up people die so you 're producing a biogas out of coal in some mines but not in others
any place you see a differential there 're some interesting questions there 's some questions as to what you should be doing with this stuff but again coal maybe the same stuff maybe the same system maybe bioenergy and you 're applying exactly the same technology
here 's your brute force approach once you get through your brute force approach then you just rip off whole mountaintops and you end up with the single largest source of carbon emissions which are coal-fired gas plants that is probably not the best use of bioenergy
as you think of what are the alternatives to this system it 's important to find alternatives because it turns out that the u.s. is dwindling in its petroleum reserves but it is not dwindling in its coal reserves nor is china there are huge coal reserves that are sitting out there and we 've got to start thinking of them as biological energy because if we keep treating them as chemical energy or engineering energy we 're going to be in deep doo-doo
gas is a similar issue gas is also a biological product and as you think of gas well you 're familiar with gas and here 's a different way of mining coal
this is called coal bed methane why is this picture interesting because if coal turns out to be concentrated plant life the reason why you may get a differential in gas output between one mine and another the reason why one mine may blow up and another one may not blow up may be because there 's stuff eating that stuff and producing gas
this is a well-known phenomenon you eat certain things you produce a lot of gas it may turn out that biological processes in coalmines have the same process if that is true then one of the ways of getting the energy out of coal may not be to rip whole mountaintops off and it may not be to burn coal it may be to have stuff process that coal in a biological fashion as you did in agriculture
that is what bioenergy is it is not ethanol it is not subsidies to a few companies it is not importing corn into iowa because you 've built so many of these ethanol plants it is beginning to understand the transition that occurred in agriculture from brute force into biological force and in the measure that you can do that you can clean some stuff and you can clean it pretty quickly
we already have some indicators of productivity on this stuff ok if you put steam into coal fields or petroleum fields that have been running for decades you can get a really substantial increase like an eight-fold increase in your output this is just the beginning stages of this stuff
and as you think of biomaterials this guy who did part of the sequencing of the human genome who just doubled the databases of genes and proteins known on earth by sailing around the world has been thinking about how you structure this and there 's a series of smart people thinking about this and they 've been putting together companies like synthetic genomics like a cambria like codon and what those companies are trying to do is to think of how do you apply biological principles to avoid brute force
think of it in the following terms think of it as beginning to program stuff for specific purposes
think of the cell as a hardware think of the genes as a software and in the measure that you begin to think of life as code that is interchangeable that can become energy that can become food that can become fiber that can become human beings that can become a whole series of things then you 've got to shift your approach as to how you 're going to structure and deal and think about energy in a very different way
what are the first principles of this stuff and where are we heading this is one of the gentle giants on the planet he 's one of the nicest human beings you 've ever met his name is hamilton smith he won the nobel for figuring out how to cut genes something called restriction enzymes
he was at hopkins when he did this and he 's such a modest guy that the day he won his mother called him and said i didn 't realize there was another ham smith at hopkins do you know he just won the nobel i mean that was mom but anyway this guy is just a class act you find him at the bench every single day working on a pipette and building stuff and one of the things this guy just built are these things
what is this this is the first transplant of naked dna where you take an entire dna operating system out of one cell insert it into a different cell and have that cell boot up as a separate species that 's one month old you will see stuff in the next month that will be just as important as this stuff
and as you think about this stuff and what the implications of this are we 're going to start not just converting ethanol from corn with very high subsidies we 're going to start thinking about biology entering energy it is very expensive to process this stuff both in economic terms and in energy terms
this is what accumulates in the tar sands of alberta these are sulfur blocks because as you separate that petroleum from the sand and use an enormous amount of energy inside that vapor steam to separate this stuff you also have to separate out the sulfur the difference between light crude and heavy crude well it 's about 14 bucks a barrel that 's why you 're building these pyramids of sulfur blocks and by the way the scale on these things is pretty large
now if you can take part of the energy content out of doing this you reduce the system and you really do start applying biological principles to energy this has to be a bridge to the point where you can get to wind to the point where you can get to solar to the point where you can get to nuclear and hopefully you won 't build the next nuclear plant on a beautiful seashore next to an earthquake fault just a thought
but in the meantime for the next decade at least the name of the game is hydrocarbons and be that oil be that gas be that coal this is what we 're dealing with and before i make this talk too long here 's what 's happening in the current energy system
86 percent of the energy we consume are hydrocarbons that means 86 percent of the stuff we 're consuming are probably processed plants and amoebas and the rest of the stuff and there 's a role in here for conservation there 's a role in here for alternative stuff but we 've also got to get that other portion right
how we deal with that other portion is our bridge to the future and as we think of this bridge to the future one of the things you should ponder is we are leaving about two-thirds of the oil today inside those wells so we 're spending an enormous amount of money and leaving most of the energy down there which of course requires more energy to go out and get energy the ratios become idiotic by the time you get to ethanol it may even be a one-to-one ratio on the energy input and the energy output that is a stupid way of managing this system
last point last graph one of the things that we 've got to do is to stabilize oil prices this is what oil prices look like ok
this is a very bad system because what happens is your hurdle rate gets set very low people come up with really smart ideas for solar panels or for wind or for something else and then guess what
the oil price goes through the floor that company goes out of business and then you can bring the oil price back up
so if i had one closing and modest suggestion let 's set a stable oil price in europe and the united states how do you do that well let 's put a tax on oil that is a non-revenue tax and it basically says for the next 20 years the price of oil will be whatever you want 35 bucks 40 bucks if the opec price falls below that we tax it if the opec price goes above that the tax goes away
what does that do for entrepreneurs what does it do for companies it tells people if you can produce energy for less than 35 bucks a barrel or less than 40 bucks a barrel or less than 50 bucks a barrel let 's debate it you will have a business but let 's not put people through this cycle where it doesn 't pay to research because your company will go out of business as opec drives alternatives and keeps bioenergy from happening thank you
who are we
that is the big question
and essentially we are just an upright-walking big-brained super-intelligent ape
this could be us
we belong to the family called the hominidae
we are the species called homo sapiens sapiens and it 's important to remember that in terms of our place in the world today and our future on planet earth
we are one species of about five and a half thousand mammalian species that exist on planet earth today
and that 's just a tiny fraction of all species that have ever lived on the planet in past times
we 're one species out of approximately or let 's say at least 16 upright-walking apes that have existed over the past six to eight million years
but as far as we know we 're the only upright-walking ape that exists on planet earth today except for the bonobos
and it 's important to remember that because the bonobos are so human and they share 99 percent of their genes with us
and we share our origins with a handful of the living great apes
it 's important to remember that we evolved
now i know that 's a dirty word for some people but we evolved from common ancestors with the gorillas the chimpanzee and also the bonobos
we have a common past and we have a common future
and it is important to remember that all of these great apes have come on as long and as interesting evolutionary journey as we ourselves have today
and it 's this journey that is of such interest to humanity and it 's this journey that has been the focus of the past three generations of my family as we 've been in east africa looking for the fossil remains of our ancestors to try and piece together our evolutionary past
and this is how we look for them
a group of dedicated young men and women walk very slowly out across vast areas of africa looking for small fragments of bone fossil bone that may be on the surface
and that 's an example of what we may do as we walk across the landscape in northern kenya looking for fossils
i doubt many of you in the audience can see the fossil that 's in this picture but if you look very carefully there is a jaw a lower jaw of a 4.1-million-year-old upright-walking ape as it was found at lake turkana on the west side
it 's extremely time-consuming labor-intensive and it is something that is going to involve a lot more people to begin to piece together our past
we still really haven 't got a very complete picture of it
when we find a fossil we mark it
today we 've got great technology we have gps
we mark it with a gps fix and we also take a digital photograph of the specimen so we could essentially put it back on the surface exactly where we found it
and we can bring all this information into big gis packages today
when we then find something very important like the bones of a human ancestor we begin to excavate it extremely carefully and slowly using dental picks and fine paintbrushes
and all the sediment is then put through these screens and where we go again through it very carefully looking for small bone fragments and it 's then washed
and these things are so exciting they are so often the only or the very first time that anybody has ever seen the remains
and here 's a very special moment when my mother and myself were digging up some remains of human ancestors
and it is one of the most special things to ever do with your mother
not many people can say that
but now let me take you back to africa two million years ago
i 'd just like to point out if you look at the map of africa it does actually look like a hominid skull in its shape
now we 're going to go to the east african and the rift valley
it essentially runs up from the gulf of aden or runs down to lake malawi
and the rift valley is a depression
it 's a basin and rivers flow down from the highlands into the basin carrying sediment preserving the bones of animals that lived there
if you want to become a fossil you actually need to die somewhere where your bones will be rapidly buried
you then hope that the earth moves in such a way as to bring the bones back up to the surface
and then you hope that one of us lot will walk around and find small pieces of you
ok so it is absolutely surprising that we know as much as we do know today about our ancestors because it 's incredibly difficult a for these things to become to be preserved and secondly for them to have been brought back up to the surface
and we really have only spent 50 years looking for these remains and begin to actually piece together our evolutionary story
so let 's go to lake turkana which is one such lake basin in the very north of our country kenya
and if you look north here there 's a big river that flows into the lake that 's been carrying sediment and preserving the remains of the animals that lived there
fossil sites run up and down both lengths of that lake basin which represents some 20,000 square miles
that 's a huge job that we 've got on our hands
two million years ago at lake turkana homo erectus one of our human ancestors actually lived in this region
you can see some of the major fossil sites that we 've been working in the north but essentially two million years ago homo erectus up in the far right corner lived alongside three other species of human ancestor
and here is a skull of a homo erectus which i just pulled off the shelf there
but it is not to say that being a single species on planet earth is the norm
in fact if you go back in time it is the norm that there are multiple species of hominids or of human ancestors that coexist at any one time
where did these things come from
that 's what we 're still trying to find answers to and it is important to realize that there is diversity in all different species and our ancestors are no exception
here 's some reconstructions of some of the fossils that have been found from lake turkana
but i was very lucky to have been brought up in kenya essentially accompanying my parents to lake turkana in search of human remains
and we were able to dig up when we got old enough fossils such as this a slender-snouted crocodile
and we dug up giant tortoises and elephants and things like that
but when i was 12 as i was in this picture a very exciting expedition was in place on the west side when they found essentially the skeleton of this homo erectus
i could relate to this homo erectus skeleton very well because i was the same age that he was when he died
and i imagined him to be tall dark-skinned
his brothers certainly were able to run long distances chasing prey probably sweating heavily as they did so
he was very able to use stones effectively as tools
and this individual himself this one that i 'm holding up here actually had a bad back he 'd probably had an injury as a child
he had a scoliosis and therefore must have been looked after quite carefully by other female and probably much smaller members of his family group to have got to where he did in life age 12
unfortunately for him he fell into a swamp and couldn 't get out
essentially his bones were rapidly buried and beautifully preserved
and he remained there until 1.6 million years later when this very famous fossil hunter kamoya kimeu walked along a small hillside and found that small piece of his skull lying on the surface amongst the pebbles recognized it as being hominid
it 's actually this little piece up here on the top
well an excavation was begun immediately and more and more little bits of skull started to be extracted from the sediment
and what was so fun about it was this the skull pieces got closer and closer to the roots of the tree and fairly recently the tree had grown up but it had found that the skull had captured nice water in the hillside and so it had decided to grow its roots in and around this holding it in place and preventing it from washing away down the slope
we began to find limb bones we found finger bones the bones of the pelvis vertebrae ribs the collar bones things that had never ever been seen before in homo erectus
it was truly exciting
he had a body very similar to our own and he was on the threshold of becoming human
well shortly afterwards members of his species started to move northwards out of africa and you start to see fossils of homo erectus in georgia china and also in parts of indonesia
so homo erectus was the first human ancestor to leave africa and begin its spread across the globe
some exciting finds again as i mentioned from dmanisi in the republic of georgia
but also surprising finds recently announced from the island of flores in indonesia where a group of these human ancestors have been isolated and have become dwarfed and they 're only about a meter in height
but they lived only 18,000 years ago and that is truly extraordinary to think about
just to put this in terms of generations because people do find it hard to think of time homo erectus left africa 90,000 generations ago
we evolved essentially from an african stock
again at about 200,000 years as a fully-fledged us
and we only left africa about 70,000 years ago
and until 30,000 years ago at least three upright-walking apes shared the planet earth
the question now is well who are we
we 're certainly a polluting wasteful aggressive species with a few nice things thrown in perhaps
for the most part we 're not particularly pleasant at all
we have a much larger brain than our ape ancestors
is this a good evolutionary adaptation or is it going to lead us to being the shortest-lived hominid species on planet earth
and what is it that really makes us us
i think it 's our collective intelligence
it 's our ability to write things down our language and our consciousness
from very primitive beginnings with a very crude tool kit of stones we now have a very advanced tool kit and our tool use has really reached unprecedented levels we 've got buggies to mars we 've mapped the human genome and recently even created synthetic life thanks to craig venter
and we 've also managed to communicate with people all over the world from extraordinary places
even from within an excavation in northern kenya we can talk to people about what we 're doing
as al gore so clearly has reminded us we have reached extraordinary numbers of people on this planet
human ancestors really only survive on planet earth if you look at the fossil record for about on average a million years at a time
we 've only been around for the past 200,000 years as a species yet we 've reached a population of more than six and a half billion people
and last year our population grew by 80 million
i mean these are extraordinary numbers
you can see here again taken from al gore 's book
but what 's happened is our technology has removed the checks and balances on our population growth
we have to control our numbers and i think this is as important as anything else that 's being done in the world today
but we have to control our numbers because we can 't really hold it together as a species
my father so appropriately put it that we are certainly the only animal that makes conscious choices that are bad for our survival as a species
can we hold it together
it 's important to remember that we all evolved in africa
we all have an african origin
we have a common past and we share a common future
evolutionarily speaking we 're just a blip
we 're sitting on the edge of a precipice and we have the tools and the technology at our hands to communicate what needs to be done to hold it together today
we could tell every single human being out there if we really wanted to
but will we do that or will we just let nature take its course
well to end on a very positive note i think evolutionarily speaking this is probably a fairly good thing in the end
i 'll leave it at that thank you very much
it is said that the grass is always greener on the other side of the fence and i believe this is true especially when i hear president obama often talk about the korean education system as a benchmark of success
well i can tell you that in the rigid structure and highly competitive nature of the korean school system also known as pressure cooker not everyone can do well in that environment
while many people responded in different ways about our education system my response to the high-pressure environment was making bows with pieces of wood found near my apartment building
why bows
i 'm not quite sure
perhaps in the face of constant pressure my caveman instinct of survival has connected with the bows
if you think about it the bow has really helped drive human survival since prehistoric times
the area within three kilometers of my home used to be a mulberry forest during the joseon dynasty where silkworms were fed with mulberry leaves
in order to raise the historical awareness of this fact the government has planted mulberry trees
the seeds from these trees also have spread by birds here and there nearby the soundproof walls of the city expressway that has been built around the 1988 olympics
the area near these walls which nobody bothers to pay attention to had been left free from major intervention and this is where i first found my treasures
as i fell deeper into bow making i began to search far and beyond my neighborhood
when i went on school field trips family vacations or simply on my way home from extracurricular classes i wandered around wooded areas and gathered tree branches with the tools that i sneaked inside my school bag
and they would be somethings like saws knives sickles and axes that i covered up with a piece of towel
i would bring the branches home riding buses and subways barely holding them in my hands
and i did not bring the tools here to long beach
airport security
in the privacy of my room covered in sawdust i would saw trim and polish wood all night long until a bow took shape
one day i was changing the shape of a bamboo piece and ended up setting the place on fire
where the rooftop of my apartment building a place where 96 families call home
a customer from a department store across from my building called 911 and i ran downstairs to tell my mom with half of my hair burned
i want to take this opportunity to tell my mom in the audience today mom i was really sorry and i will be more careful with open fire from now on
my mother had to do a lot of explaining telling people that her son did not commit a premeditated arson
i also researched extensively on bows around the world
in that process i tried to combine the different bows from across time and places to create the most effective bow
i also worked with many different types of wood such as maple yew and mulberry and did many shooting experiments in the wooded area near the urban expressway that i mentioned before
the most effective bow for me would be like this
one curved tips can maximize the springiness when you draw and shoot the arrow
two belly is drawn inward for higher draw weight which means more power
three sinew used in the outer layer of the limb for maximum tension storage
and four horn used to store energy in compression
after fixing breaking redesigning mending bending and amending my ideal bow began to take shape and when it was finally done it looked like this
i was so proud of myself for inventing a perfect bow on my own
this is a picture of korean traditional bows taken from a museum and see how my bow resembles them
thanks to my ancestors for robbing me of my invention
through bowmaking i came in contact with part of my heritage
learning the information that has accumulated over time and reading the message left by my ancestors were better than any consolation therapy or piece of advice any living adults could give me
you see i searched far and wide but never bothered to look close and near
from this realization i began to take interest in korean history which had never inspired me before
in the end the grass is often greener on my side of the fence although we don 't realize it
now i am going to show you how my bow works
and let 's see how this one works
this is a bamboo bow with 45-pound draw weights
a bow may function in a simple mechanism but in order to make a good bow a great amount of sensitivity is required
you need to console and communicate with the wood material
each fiber in the wood has its own reason and function for being and only through cooperation and harmony among them comes a great bow
i may be an [ odd ] student with unconventional interests but i hope i am making a contribution by sharing my story with all of you
my ideal world is a place where no one is left behind where everyone is needed exactly where they are like the fibers and the tendons in a bow a place where the strong is flexible and the vulnerable is resilient
the bow resembles me and i resemble the bow
now i am shooting a part of myself to you
no better yet a part of my mind has just been shot over to your mind
did it strike you
thank you
now have any of y 'all ever looked up this word
you know in a dictionary yeah that 's what i thought
how about this word
here i 'll show it to you
lexicography the practice of compiling dictionaries
notice we 're very specific that word compile
the dictionary is not carved out of a piece of granite out of a lump of rock it 's made up of lots of little bits
it 's little discrete that 's spelled d-i-s-c-r-e-t-e bits
and those bits are words
now one of the perks of being a lexicographer besides getting to come to ted is that you get to say really fun words like lexicographical
lexicographical has this great pattern it 's called a double dactyl and just by saying double dactyl i 've sent the geek needle all the way into the red
but lexicographical is the same pattern as higgledy-piggledy
right it 's a fun word to say and i get to say it a lot
now one of the non-perks of being a lexicographer is that people don 't usually have a kind of warm fuzzy snuggly image of the dictionary
right nobody hugs their dictionaries
but what people really often think about the dictionary is they think more like this
just to let you know i do not have a lexicographical whistle
but people think that my job is to let the good words make that difficult left-hand turn into the dictionary and keep the bad words out
but the thing is i don 't want to be a traffic cop
for one thing i just do not do uniforms
and for another deciding what words are good and what words are bad is actually not very easy
and it 's not very fun and when parts of your job are not easy or fun you kind of look for an excuse not to do them
so if i had to think of some kind of occupation as a metaphor for my work i would much rather be a fisherman
i want to throw my big net into the deep blue ocean of english and see what marvelous creatures i can drag up from the bottom
but why do people want me to direct traffic when i would much rather go fishing
well i blame the queen
why do i blame the queen
well first of all i blame the queen because it 's funny
but secondly i blame the queen because dictionaries have really not changed
our idea of what a dictionary is has not changed since her reign
the only thing that queen victoria would not be amused by in modern dictionaries is our inclusion of the f-word which has happened in american dictionaries since 1965
so there 's this guy right victorian era
james murray first editor of the oxford english dictionary
i do not have that hat i wish i had that hat
so he 's really responsible for a lot of what we consider modern in dictionaries today
when a guy who looks like that in that hat is the face of modernity you have a problem
and so james murray could get a job on any dictionary today
there 'd be virtually no learning curve
and of course a few of us are saying okay computers
computers what about computers
the thing about computers is i love computers
i mean i 'm a huge geek i love computers
i would go on a hunger strike before i let them take away google book search from me
but computers don 't do much else other than speed up the process of compiling dictionaries
they don 't change the end result
because what a dictionary is is it 's victorian design merged with a little bit of modern propulsion
it 's steampunk what we have is an electric velocipede
you know we have victorian design with an engine on it that 's all
the design has not changed
and ok what about online dictionaries right
online dictionaries must be different
this is the oxford english dictionary online one of the best online dictionaries
this is my favorite word by the way
erinaceous pertaining to the hedgehog family of the nature of a hedgehog
very useful word so look at that
online dictionaries right now are paper thrown up on a screen
this is flat look how many links there are in the actual entry two
right those little buttons i had them all expanded except for the date chart
so there 's not very much going on here
there 's not a lot of clickiness
and in fact online dictionaries replicate almost all the problems of print except for searchability
and when you improve searchability you actually take away the one advantage of print which is serendipity
serendipity is when you find things you weren 't looking for because finding what you are looking for is so damned difficult
so now when you think about this what we have here is a ham butt problem
does everyone know the ham butt problem
woman 's making a ham for a big family dinner
she goes to cut the butt off the ham and throw it away and she looks at this piece of ham and she 's like this is a perfectly good piece of ham why am i throwing this away
she thought well my mom always did this
so she calls up mom and she says mom why 'd you cut the butt off the ham when you 're making a ham
she says i don 't know my mom always did it
so they call grandma and grandma says my pan was too small
so it 's not that we have good words and bad words
we have a pan that 's too small
you know that ham butt is delicious there 's no reason to throw it away
the bad words see when people think about a place and they don 't find a place on the map they think this map sucks
when they find a nightspot or a bar and it 's not in the guidebook they 're like ooh this place must be cool it 's not in the guidebook
when they find a word that 's not in the dictionary they think this must be a bad word why it 's more likely to be a bad dictionary
why are you blaming the ham for being too big for the pan
so you can 't get a smaller ham
the english language is as big as it is
so if you have a ham butt problem and you 're thinking about the ham butt problem the conclusion that it leads you to is inexorable and counterintuitive paper is the enemy of words
how can this be i mean i love books i really love books
some of my best friends are books
but the book is not the best shape for the dictionary
now they 're going to think oh boy
people are going to take away my beautiful paper dictionaries
no there will still be paper dictionaries
when we had cars when cars became the dominant mode of transportation we didn 't round up all the horses and shoot them
you know there 're still going to be paper dictionaries but it 's not going to be the dominant dictionary
the book-shaped dictionary is not going to be the only shape dictionaries come in and it 's not going to be the prototype for the shapes dictionaries come in
so think about it this way if you 've got an artificial constraint artificial constraints lead to arbitrary distinctions and a skewed worldview
what if biologists could only study animals that made people go aww right
what if we made aesthetic judgments about animals and only the ones we thought were cute were the ones that we could study
we 'd know a whole lot about charismatic megafauna and not very much about much else
and i think this is a problem
i think we should study all the words because when you think about words you can make beautiful expressions from very humble parts
lexicography is really more about material science
we are studying the tolerances of the materials that you use to build the structure of your expression your speeches and your writing and then often people say to me well ok how do i know that this word is real
they think ok if we think words are the tools that we use to build the expressions of our thoughts how can you say that screwdrivers are better than hammers
how can you say that a sledgehammer is better than a ball-peen hammer
they 're just the right tools for the job
and so people say to me how do i know if a word is real
you know anybody who 's read a children 's book knows that love makes things real
if you love a word use it that makes it real
being in the dictionary is an artificial distinction
it doesn 't make a word any more real than any other way
if you love a word it becomes real
so if we 're not worrying about directing traffic if we 've transcended paper if we are worrying less about control and more about description then we can think of the english language as being this beautiful mobile
and any time one of those little parts of the mobile changes is touched any time you touch a word you use it in a new context you give it a new connotation you verb it you make the mobile move
you didn 't break it it 's just in a new position and that new position can be just as beautiful
now if you 're no longer a traffic cop the problem with being a traffic cop is there can only be so many traffic cops in any one intersection or the cars get confused right
but if your goal is no longer to direct the traffic but maybe to count the cars that go by then more eyeballs are better
you can ask for help
if you ask for help you get more done and we really need help
library of congress 17 million books of which half are in english
if only one out of every 10 of those books had a word that 's not in the dictionary in it that would be equivalent to more than two unabridged dictionaries
and i find an un-dictionaried word a word like un-dictionaried for example in almost every book i read what about newspapers
newspaper archive goes back to 1759 58.1 million newspaper pages if only one in 100 of those pages had an un-dictionaried word on it it would be an entire other oed
that 's 500,000 more words so that 's a lot
and i 'm not even talking about magazines i 'm not talking about blogs and i find more new words on boingboing in a given week than i do newsweek or time
there 's a lot going on there
and i 'm not even talking about polysemy which is the greedy habit some words have of taking more than one meaning for themselves
so if you think of the word set a set can be a badger 's burrow a set can be one of the pleats in an elizabethan ruff and there 's one numbered definition in the oed
the oed has 33 different numbered definitions for set
tiny little word 33 numbered definitions
one of them is just labeled miscellaneous technical senses
do you know what that says to me
that says to me it was friday afternoon and somebody wanted to go down the pub
that 's a lexicographical cop out to say miscellaneous technical senses
so we have all these words and we really need help
and the thing is we could ask for help asking for help 's not that hard
i mean lexicography is not rocket science
see i just gave you a lot of words and a lot of numbers and this is more of a visual explanation
if we think of the dictionary as being the map of the english language these bright spots are what we know about and the dark spots are where we are in the dark
if that was the map of all the words in american english we don 't know very much
and we don 't even know the shape of the language
if this was the dictionary if this was the map of american english look we have a kind of lumpy idea of florida but there 's no california
we 're missing california from american english
we just don 't know enough and we don 't even know that we 're missing california
we don 't even see that there 's a gap on the map
so again lexicography is not rocket science
but even if it were rocket science is being done by dedicated amateurs these days you know
it can 't be that hard to find some words
so enough scientists in other disciplines are really asking people to help and they 're doing a good job of it
for instance there 's ebird where amateur birdwatchers can upload information about their bird sightings
and then ornithologists can go and help track populations migrations etc
and there 's this guy mike oates mike oates lives in the u.k.
he 's a director of an electroplating company
he 's found more than 140 comets
he 's found so many comets they named a comet after him
it 's kind of out past mars it 's a hike
i don 't think he 's getting his picture taken there anytime soon
but he found 140 comets without a telescope
he downloaded data from the nasa soho satellite and that 's how he found them
if we can find comets without a telescope shouldn 't we be able to find words
now y 'all know where i 'm going with this
because i 'm going to the internet which is where everybody goes
and the internet is great for collecting words because the internet 's full of collectors
and this is a little-known technological fact about the internet but the internet is actually made up of words and enthusiasm
and words and enthusiasm actually happen to be the recipe for lexicography isn 't that great
so there are a lot of really good word-collecting sites out there right now but the problem with some of them is that they 're not scientific enough
they show the word but they don 't show any context
where did it come from who said it
what newspaper was it in what book
because a word is like an archaeological artifact
if you don 't know the provenance or the source of the artifact it 's not science it 's a pretty thing to look at
so a word without its source is like a cut flower
you know it 's pretty to look at for a while but then it dies
it dies too fast
so this whole time i 've been saying the dictionary the dictionary the dictionary the dictionary
not a dictionary or dictionaries and that 's because well people use the dictionary to stand for the whole language
they use it synecdochically
and one of the problems of knowing a word like synecdochically is that you really want an excuse to say synecdochically
this whole talk has just been an excuse to get me to the point where i could say synecdochically to all of you
so i 'm really sorry but when you use a part of something like the dictionary is a part of the language or a flag stands for the united states it 's a symbol of the country then you 're using it synecdochically
but the thing is we could make the dictionary the whole language
if we get a bigger pan then we can put all the words in
we can put in all the meanings
doesn 't everyone want more meaning in their lives
and we can make the dictionary not just be a symbol of the language we can make it be the whole language
you see what i 'm really hoping for is that my son who turns seven this month i want him to barely remember that this is the form factor that dictionaries used to come in
this is what dictionaries used to look like
i want him to think of this kind of dictionary as an eight-track tape
it 's a format that died because it wasn 't useful enough
it wasn 't really what people needed
and the thing is if we can put in all the words no longer have that artificial distinction between good and bad we can really describe the language like scientists
we can leave the aesthetic judgments to the writers and the speakers
if we can do that then i can spend all my time fishing and i don 't have to be a traffic cop anymore
thank you very much for your kind attention
i thought i would talk a little bit about how nature makes materials
i brought along with me an abalone shell
this abalone shell is a biocomposite material that 's 98 percent by mass calcium carbonate and two percent by mass protein
yet it 's 3,000 times tougher than its geological counterpart
and a lot of people might use structures like abalone shells like chalk
i 've been fascinated by how nature makes materials and there 's a lot of sequence to how they do such an exquisite job
part of it is that these materials are macroscopic in structure but they 're formed at the nanoscale
they 're formed at the nanoscale and they use proteins that are coded by the genetic level that allow them to build these really exquisite structures
so something i think is very fascinating is what if you could give life to non-living structures like batteries and like solar cells
what if they had some of the same capabilities that an abalone shell did in terms of being able to build really exquisite structures at room temperature and room pressure using non-toxic chemicals and adding no toxic materials back into the environment
so that 's the vision that i 've been thinking about
and so what if you could grow a battery in a petri dish
or what if you could give genetic information to a battery so that it could actually become better as a function of time and do so in an environmentally friendly way
and so going back to this abalone shell besides being nano-structured one thing that 's fascinating is when a male and a female abalone get together they pass on the genetic information that says this is how to build an exquisite material
here 's how to do it at room temperature and pressure using non-toxic materials
same with diatoms which are shown right here which are glasseous structures
every time the diatoms replicate they give the genetic information that says here 's how to build glass in the ocean that 's perfectly nano-structured
and you can do it the same over and over again
so what if you could do the same thing with a solar cell or a battery
i like to say my favorite biomaterial is my four year-old
but anyone who 's ever had or knows small children knows they 're incredibly complex organisms
and so if you wanted to convince them to do something they don 't want to do it 's very difficult
so when we think about future technologies we actually think of using bacteria and virus simple organisms
can you convince them to work with a new toolbox so that they can build a structure that will be important to me
also when we think about future technologies we start with the beginning of earth
basically it took a billion years to have life on earth
and very rapidly they became multi-cellular they could replicate they could use photosynthesis as a way of getting their energy source
but it wasn 't until about 500 million years ago during the cambrian geologic time period that organisms in the ocean started making hard materials
before that they were all soft fluffy structures
and it was during this time that there was increased calcium and iron and silicon in the environment and organisms learned how to make hard materials
and so that 's what i would like be able to do convince biology to work with the rest of the periodic table
now if you look at biology there 's many structures like dna and antibodies and proteins and ribosomes that you 've heard about that are already nano-structured
so nature already gives us really exquisite structures on the nanoscale
what if we could harness them and convince them to not be an antibody that does something like hiv
but what if we could convince them to build a solar cell for us
so here are some examples these are some natural shells
there are natural biological materials
the abalone shell here and if you fracture it you can look at the fact that it 's nano-structured
there 's diatoms made out of sio2 and they 're magnetotactic bacteria that make small single-domain magnets used for navigation
what all these have in common is these materials are structured at the nanoscale and they have a dna sequence that codes for a protein sequence that gives them the blueprint to be able to build these really wonderful structures
now going back to the abalone shell the abalone makes this shell by having these proteins
these proteins are very negatively charged
and they can pull calcium out of the environment put down a layer of calcium and then carbonate calcium and carbonate
it has the chemical sequences of amino acids which says this is how to build the structure
here 's the dna sequence here 's the protein sequence in order to do it
and so an interesting idea is what if you could take any material that you wanted or any element on the periodic table and find its corresponding dna sequence then code it for a corresponding protein sequence to build a structure but not build an abalone shell build something that through nature it has never had the opportunity to work with yet
and so here 's the periodic table
and i absolutely love the periodic table
every year for the incoming freshman class at mit i have a periodic table made that says welcome to mit now you 're in your element
and you flip it over and it 's the amino acids with the ph at which they have different charges
and so i give this out to thousands of people
and i know it says mit and this is caltech but i have a couple extra if people want it
and i was really fortunate to have president obama visit my lab this year on his visit to mit and i really wanted to give him a periodic table
so i stayed up at night and i talked to my husband how do i give president obama a periodic table
what if he says oh i already have one or i 've already memorized it
and so he came to visit my lab and looked around it was a great visit
and then afterward i said sir i want to give you the periodic table in case you 're ever in a bind and need to calculate molecular weight
and i thought molecular weight sounded much less nerdy than molar mass
and so he looked at it and he said thank you i 'll look at it periodically
and later in a lecture that he gave on clean energy he pulled it out and said and people at mit they give out periodic tables
so basically what i didn 't tell you is that about 500 million years ago organisms starter making materials but it took them about 50 million years to get good at it
it took them about 50 million years to learn how to perfect how to make that abalone shell
and that 's a hard sell to a graduate student
i have this great project 50 million years
and so we had to develop a way of trying to do this more rapidly
and so we use a virus that 's a non-toxic virus called m13 bacteriophage that 's job is to infect bacteria
well it has a simple dna structure that you can go in and cut and paste additional dna sequences into it
and by doing that it allows the virus to express random protein sequences
and this is pretty easy biotechnology
and you could basically do this a billion times
and so you can go in and have a billion different viruses that are all genetically identical but they differ from each other based on their tips on one sequence that codes for one protein
now if you take all billion viruses and you can put them in one drop of liquid you can force them to interact with anything you want on the periodic table
and through a process of selection evolution you can pull one out of a billion that does something that you 'd like it to do like grow a battery or grow a solar cell
so basically viruses can 't replicate themselves they need a host
once you find that one out of a billion you infect it into a bacteria and you make millions and billions of copies of that particular sequence
and so the other thing that 's beautiful about biology is that biology gives you really exquisite structures with nice link scales
and these viruses are long and skinny and we can get them to express the ability to grow something like semiconductors or materials for batteries
now this is a high-powered battery that we grew in my lab
we engineered a virus to pick up carbon nanotubes
so one part of the virus grabs a carbon nanotube
the other part of the virus has a sequence that can grow an electrode material for a battery
and then it wires itself to the current collector
and so through a process of selection evolution we went from being able to have a virus that made a crummy battery to a virus that made a good battery to a virus that made a record-breaking high-powered battery that 's all made at room temperature basically at the bench top
and that battery went to the white house for a press conference
i brought it here
you can see it in this case that 's lighting this led
now if we could scale this you could actually use it to run your prius which is my dream to be able to drive a virus-powered car
but it 's basically you can pull one out of a billion
you can make lots of amplifications to it
basically you make an amplification in the lab and then you get it to self-assemble into a structure like a battery
we 're able to do this also with catalysis
this is the example of photocatalytic splitting of water
and what we 've been able to do is engineer a virus to basically take dye-absorbing molecules and line them up on the surface of the virus so it acts as an antenna and you get an energy transfer across the virus
and then we give it a second gene to grow an inorganic material that can be used to split water into oxygen and hydrogen that can be used for clean fuels
and i brought an example with me of that today
my students promised me it would work
these are virus-assembled nanowires
when you shine light on them you can see them bubbling
in this case you 're seeing oxygen bubbles come out
and basically by controlling the genes you can control multiple materials to improve your device performance
the last example are solar cells
you can also do this with solar cells
we 've been able to engineer viruses to pick up carbon nanotubes and then grow titanium dioxide around them and use as a way of getting electrons through the device
and what we 've found is through genetic engineering we can actually increase the efficiencies of these solar cells to record numbers for these types of dye-sensitized systems
and i brought one of those as well that you can play around with outside afterward
so this is a virus-based solar cell
through evolution and selection we took it from an eight percent efficiency solar cell to an 11 percent efficiency solar cell
so i hope that i 've convinced you that there 's a lot of great interesting things to be learned about how nature makes materials and taking it the next step to see if you can force or whether you can take advantage of how nature makes materials to make things that nature hasn 't yet dreamed of making
thank you
about 15 years ago i went to visit a friend in hong kong
and at the time i was very superstitious
so upon landing this was still at the old hong kong airport that 's kai tak when it was smack in the middle of the city i thought if i see something good i 'm going to have a great time here in my two weeks and if i see something negative i 'm going to be miserable indeed
so the plane landed in between the buildings and got to a full stop in front of this little billboard
and i actually went to see some of the design companies in hong kong in my stay there
and it turned out that i just went to see you know what they are doing in hong kong
but i actually walked away with a great job offer
and i flew back to austria packed my bags and another week later i was again on my way to hong kong still superstitions and thinking well if that winner billboard is still up i 'm going to have a good time working here
but if it 's gone it 's going to be really miserable and stressful
so it turned out that not only was the billboard still up but they had put this one right next to it
on the other hand it also taught me where superstition gets me because i really had a terrible time in hong kong
however i did have a number of real moments of happiness in my life of you know i think what the conference brochure refers to as moments that take your breath away
and since i 'm a big list maker i actually listed them all
now you don 't have to go through the trouble of reading them and i won 't read them for you
i know that it 's incredibly boring to hear about other people 's happinesses
what i did do though is i actually looked at them from a design standpoint and just eliminated all the ones that had nothing to do with design
and very surprisingly over half of them had actually something to do with design
so there are of course two different possibilities
there 's one from a consumer 's point of view where i was happy while experiencing design
and i 'll just give you one example i had gotten my first walkman
this is 1983
my brother had this great yamaha motorcycle that he was willing to borrow to me freely
and the police 's synchronicity cassette had just been released and there was no helmet law in my hometown of bregenz
so you could drive up into the mountains freely blasting the police on the new sony walkman
and i remember it as a true moment of happiness
you know of course they are related to this combination of at least two of them being you know design objects
and you know there 's a scale of happiness when you talk about in design but the motorcycle incident would definitely be you know situated somewhere here right in there between delight and bliss
now there is the other part from a designer 's standpoint if you 're happy while actually doing it
and one way to see how happy designers are when they 're designing could be to look at the authors photos on the back of their monographs
so according to this the australians and the japanese as well as the mexicans are very happy
while somewhat the spaniards ...
and i think particularly the swiss don 't seem to be doing all that well
last november a museum opened in tokyo called the mori museum in a skyscraper up on the 56th floor
and their inaugural exhibit was called happiness
and i went very eagerly to see it because well also with an eye on this conference
and they interestingly sectioned the exhibit off into four different areas
under arcadia they showed things like this from the edo period a hundred ways to write happiness in different forms
or they had this apple by yoko ono that of course later on was you know made into the label for the beatles
under nirvana they showed this constable painting
and there was a little an interesting theory about abstraction
this is a blue field it 's actually an yves klein painting
and the theory was that if you abstract an image you really you know open as much room for the un-representable and therefore you know are able to involve the viewer more
then under desire they showed these shunsho paintings also from the edo period ink on silk
and lastly under harmony they had this 13th-century mandala from tibet
now what i took away from the exhibit was that maybe with the exception of the mandala most of the pieces in there were actually about the visualization of happiness and not about happiness
and i felt a little bit cheated because the visualization that 's a really easy thing to do
and you know my studio we 've done it all the time
this is you know a book
a happy dog and you take it out it 's an aggressive dog
it 's a happy david byrne and an angry david byrne
or a jazz poster with a happy face and a more aggressive face
you know that 's not a big deal to accomplish
it has gotten to the point where you know within advertising or within the movie industry happy has gotten such a bad reputation that if you actually want to do something with the subject and still appear authentic you almost would have to you know do it from a cynical point of view
this is you know the movie poster
or we a couple of weeks ago designed a box set for the talking heads where the happiness visualized on the cover definitely has very much a dark side to it
much much more difficult is this where the designs actually can evoke happiness and i 'm going to just show you three that actually did this for me
this is a campaign done by a young artist in new york who calls himself true
everybody who has ridden the new york subway system will be familiar with these signs
true printed his own version of these signs
met every wednesday at a subway stop with 20 of his friends
they divided up the different subway lines and added their own version
so this is one
now the way this works in the system is that nobody ever looks at these signs
so you 're you 're really bored in the subway and you kind of stare at something
and it takes you a while until it actually you realize that this says something different than what it normally says
i mean that 's at least how it made me happy
now true is a real humanitarian
he didn 't want any of his friends to be arrested so he supplied everybody with this fake volunteer card
and also gave this fake letter from the mta to everybody sort of like pretending that it 's an art project financed by the metropolitan transit authority
another new york project
this is at p.s. 1 a sculpture that 's basically a square room by james turrell that has a retractable ceiling
opens up at dusk and dawn every day
you don 't see the horizon
you 're just in there watching the incredible subtle changes of color in the sky
and the room is truly something to be seen
people 's demeanor changes when they go in there
and for sure i haven 't looked at the sky in the same way after spending an hour in there
there are of course more than those three projects that i 'm showing here
i would definitely say that observing vik muniz cloud a couple of years ago in manhattan for sure made me happy as well
but my last project is again from a young designer in new york
he 's from korea originally
and he took it upon himself to print 55,000 speech bubbles empty speech bubbles stickers large ones and small ones
and he goes around new york and just puts them empty as they are on posters
and other people go and fill them in
this one says please let me die in peace
i think that was the most surprising to myself was that the writing was actually so good
this is on a musician poster that says i am concerned that my cd will not sell more than 200,000 units and that as a result my recoupable advance from my label will be taken from me after which my contract will be cancelled and i 'll be back doing journey covers on bleecker street
i think the reason this works so well is because everybody involved wins
jee gets to have his project the public gets a sweeter environment and different public gets a place to express itself and the advertisers finally get somebody to look at their ads
well there was a question of course that was on my mind for a while you know can i do more of the things that i like doing in design and less of the ones that i don 't like to be doing
which brought me back to my list making you know just to see what i actually like about my job
you know one is just working without pressure
then working concentrated without being frazzled
or as nancy said before like really immerse oneself into it
try not to get stuck doing the same thing or try not get stuck behind the computer all day
this is you know related to it getting out of the studio
then of course trying to you know work on things where the content is actually important for me
and being able to enjoy the end results
and then i found another list in one of my diaries that actually contained all the things that i thought i learned in my life so far
and just about at that time an austrian magazine called and asked if we would want to do six spreads design six spreads that work like dividing pages between the different chapters in the magazine
and the whole thing just fell together
so i just picked one of the things that i thought i learned in this case everything i do always comes back to me and we made these spreads right out of this
so it was everything i do always comes back to me
a couple of weeks ago a french company asked us to design five billboards for them
again we could supply the content for it
so i just picked another one
and this was two weeks ago
we flew to arizona the designer who works with me and myself and photographed this one
so it 's trying to look good limits my life
and then we did one more of these
this is again for a magazine dividing pages
this is having this is the same thing it 's just you know photographed from the side
this is from the front
then it 's guts
again it 's the same thing guts is just the same room reworked
then it 's always works out
then it 's for with the light on
and it 's me
thank you so much

those of you who know me know how passionate i am about opening the space frontier
so when i had the chance to give the world 's expert in gravity the experience of zero gravity it was incredible
and i want to tell you that story
i first met him through the archon x prize for genomics
it 's a competition we 're holding the second x prize for the first team to sequence 100 human genomes in 10 days
we have something called the genome 100 100 individuals we 're sequencing as part of that
craig venter chairs that event
and i met professor hawking and he said his dream was to travel into space
and i said i can 't take you there but i can take you into weightlessness into zero-g
and he said on the spot absolutely yes
well the only way to experience zero-g on earth is actually with parabolic flight weightless flight
you take an airplane you fly over the top you 're weightless for 25 seconds
come back down you weigh twice as much
you do it again and again
you can get eight 10 minutes of weightlessness how nasa 's trained their astronauts for so long
we set out to do this
it took us 11 years to become operational
and we announced that we were going to fly stephen hawking
we had one government agency and one company aircraft operator say you 're crazy don 't do that you 're going kill the guy
and he wanted to go
we worked hard to get all the permissions
and six months later we sat down at kennedy space center
we had a press conference we announced our intent to do one zero-g parabola give him 25 seconds of zero-g
and if it went really well we might do three parabolas
well we asked him why he wanted to go up and do this
and what he said for me was very moving
he said life on earth is at an ever-increasing risk of being wiped out by disaster ...
i think the human race doesn 't have a future if it doesn 't go into space
i therefore want to encourage public interest in space
we took him out to the kennedy space center up inside the nasa vehicle into the back of the zero-g airplane
we had about 20 people who made donations we raised $ 150,000 in donations for children 's charities who flew with us
a few tedsters here
we set up a whole er
we had four emergency room doctors and two nurses on board the airplane
we were monitoring his po2 of his blood his heart rate his blood pressure
we had everything all set in case of an emergency god knows you don 't want to hurt this world-renowned expert
we took off from the shuttle landing facility where the shuttle takes off and lands
and my partner byron lichtenberg and i carefully suspended him into zero-g
once he was there [ we ] let him go to experience what weightlessness was truly like
and after that first parabola you know the doc said everything is great he was smiling and we said go
so we did a second parabola
and a third
we actually floated an apple in homage to sir isaac newton because professor hawking holds the same chair at cambridge that isaac newton did
and we did a fourth and a fifth and a sixth
and a seventh and an eighth
and this man does not look like a 65-year-old wheelchair-bound man
he was so happy
we are living on a precious jewel and it 's during our lifetime that we 're moving off this planet
please join us in this epic adventure
thank you so much

so people want a lot of things out of life but i think more than anything else they want happiness
aristotle called happiness the chief good the end towards which all other things aim
according to this view the reason we want a big house or a nice car or a good job isn 't that these things are intrinsically valuable
it 's that we expect them to bring us happiness
now in the last 50 years we americans have gotten a lot of the things that we want we 're richer
we live longer we have access to technology that would have seemed like science fiction just a few years ago
the paradox of happiness is that even though the objective conditions of our lives have improved dramatically we haven 't actually gotten any happier
maybe because these conventional notions of progress haven 't delivered big benefits in terms of happiness there 's been an increased interest in recent years in happiness itself
people have been debating the causes of happiness for a really long time in fact for thousands of years but it seems like many of those debates remain unresolved
well as with many other domains in life i think the scientific method has the potential to answer this question
in fact in the last few years there 's been an explosion in research on happiness for example we 've learned a lot about its demographics how things like income and education gender and marriage relate to it
but one of the puzzles this has revealed is that factors like these don 't seem to have a particularly strong effect
yes it 's better to make more money rather than less or to graduate from college instead of dropping out but the differences in happiness tend to be small
which leaves the question what are the big causes of happiness
i think that 's a question we haven 't really answered yet but i think something that has the potential to be an answer is that maybe happiness has an awful lot to do with the contents of our moment-to-moment experiences
it certainly seems that we 're going about our lives that what we 're doing who we 're with what we 're thinking about have a big influence on our happiness and yet these are the very factors that have been very difficult in fact almost impossible for scientists to study
a few years ago i came up with a way to study people 's happiness moment to moment as they 're going about their daily lives on a massive scale all over the world something we 'd never been able to do before called trackyourhappiness.org it uses the iphone to monitor people 's happiness in real time
how does this work basically i send people signals at random points throughout the day and then i ask them a bunch of questions about their moment-to-moment experience at the instant just before the signal
the idea is that if we can watch how people 's happiness goes up and down over the course of the day minute to minute in some cases and try to understand how what people are doing who they 're with what they 're thinking about and all the other factors that describe our day how those might relate to those changes in happiness we might be able to discover some of the things that really have a big influence on happiness
we 've been fortunate with this project to collect quite a lot of data a lot more data of this kind than i think has ever been collected before over 650,000 real-time reports from over 15,000 people
and it 's not just a lot of people it 's a really diverse group people from a wide range of ages from 18 to late 80s a wide range of incomes education levels people who are married divorced widowed etc
they collectively represent every one of 86 occupational categories and hail from over 80 countries
what i 'd like to do with the rest of my time with you today is talk a little bit about one of the areas that we 've been investigating and that 's mind-wandering
as human beings we have this unique ability to have our minds stray away from the present
this guy is sitting here working on his computer and yet he could be thinking about the vacation he had last month wondering what he 's going to have for dinner
maybe he 's worried that he 's going bald
this ability to focus our attention on something other than the present is really amazing it allows us to learn and plan and reason in ways that no other species of animal can
and yet it 's not clear what the relationship is between our use of this ability and our happiness
you 've probably heard people suggest that you should stay focused on the present be here now you 've probably heard a hundred times
maybe to really be happy we need to stay completely immersed and focused on our experience in the moment
maybe these people are right maybe mind-wandering is a bad thing
on the other hand when our minds wander they 're unconstrained we can 't change the physical reality in front of us but we can go anywhere in our minds
since we know people want to be happy maybe when our minds wander they 're going to someplace happier than the place that they 're leaving it would make a lot of sense
in other words maybe the pleasures of the mind allow us to increase our happiness with mind-wandering
well since i 'm a scientist i 'd like to try to resolve this debate with some data and in particular i 'd like to present some data to you from three questions that i ask with track your happiness remember this is from sort of moment-to-moment experience in people 's real lives
there are three questions the first one is a happiness question how do you feel on a scale ranging from very bad to very good second an activity question what are you doing on a list of 22 different activities including things like eating and working and watching tv
and finally a mind-wandering question are you thinking about something other than what you 're currently doing
people could say no in other words i 'm focused only on my task or yes i am thinking about something else and the topic of those thoughts are pleasant neutral or unpleasant
any of those yes responses are what we called mind-wandering
so what did we find
this graph shows happiness on the vertical axis and you can see that bar there representing how happy people are when they 're focused on the present when they 're not mind-wandering
as it turns out people are substantially less happy when their minds are wandering than when they 're not
now you might look at this result and say okay sure on average people are less happy when they 're mind-wandering but surely when their minds are straying away from something that wasn 't very enjoyable to begin with at least then mind-wandering should be doing something good for us
nope as it turns out people are less happy when they 're mind-wandering no matter what they 're doing for example people don 't really like commuting to work very much
it 's one of their least enjoyable activities and yet they are substantially happier when they 're focused only on their commute than when their mind is going off to something else
it 's amazing
so how could this be happening i think part of the reason a big part of the reason is that when our minds wander we often think about unpleasant things and they are enormously less happy when they do that our worries our anxieties our regrets and yet even when people are thinking about something neutral they 're still considerably less happy than when they 're not mind-wandering at all
even when they 're thinking about something they would describe as pleasant they 're actually just slightly less happy than when they aren 't mind-wandering
if mind-wandering were a slot machine it would be like having the chance to lose 50 dollars 20 dollars or one dollar right you 'd never want to play
so i 've been talking about this suggesting perhaps that mind-wandering causes unhappiness but all i 've really shown you is that these two things are correlated
it 's possible that 's the case but it might also be the case that when people are unhappy then they mind-wander
maybe that 's what 's really going on how could we ever disentangle these two possibilites
well one fact that we can take advantage of i think a fact you 'll all agree is true is that time goes forward not backward right the cause has to come before the effect
we 're lucky in this data we have many responses from each person and so we can look and see does mind-wandering tend to precede unhappiness or does unhappiness tend to precede mind-wandering to get some insight into the causal direction
as it turns out there is a strong relationship between mind-wandering now and being unhappy a short time later consistent with the idea that mind-wandering is causing people to be unhappy
in contrast there 's no relationship between being unhappy now and mind-wandering a short time later
in other words mind-wandering very likely seems to be an actual cause and not merely a consequence of unhappiness
a few minutes ago i likened mind-wandering to a slot machine you 'd never want to play
well how often do people 's minds wander
turns out they wander a lot in fact really a lot
forty-seven percent of the time people are thinking about something other than what they 're currently doing
how does that depend on what people are doing
this shows the rate of mind-wandering across 22 activities ranging from a high of 65 percent when people are taking a shower brushing their teeth to 50 percent when they 're working to 40 percent when they 're exercising all the way down to this one short bar on the right that i think some of you are probably laughing at
ten percent of the time people 's minds are wandering when they 're having sex
but there 's something i think that 's quite interesting in this graph and that is basically with one exception no matter what people are doing they 're mind-wandering at least 30 percent of the time which suggests i think that mind-wandering isn 't just frequent it 's ubiquitous
it pervades basically everything that we do
in my talk today i 've told you a little bit about mind-wandering a variable that i think turns out to be fairly important in the equation for happiness
my hope is that over time by tracking people 's moment-to-moment happiness and their experiences in daily life we 'll be able to uncover a lot of important causes of happiness and then in the end a scientific understanding of happiness will help us create a future that 's not only richer and healthier but happier as well
thank you
this is an ambucycle
this is the fastest way to reach any medical emergency
it has everything an ambulance has except for a bed
you see the defibrillator you see the equipment
we all saw the tragedy that happened in boston
when i was looking at these pictures it brought me back many years to my past when i was a child
i grew up in a small neighborhood in jerusalem
when i was six years old i was walking back from school on a friday afternoon with my older brother
we were passing by a bus stop
we saw a bus blow up in front of our eyes
the bus was on fire and many people were hurt and killed
i remembered an old man yelling to us and crying to help us get him up
he just needed someone helping him
we were so scared and we just ran away
growing up i decided i wanted to become a doctor and save lives
maybe that was because of what i saw when i was a child
when i was 15 i took an emt course and i went to volunteer on an ambulance
for two years i volunteered on an ambulance in jerusalem
i helped many people but whenever someone really needed help i never got there in time we never got there
the traffic is so bad the distance and everything
we never got there when somebody really needed us
one day we received a call about a seven-year-old child choking from a hot dog
traffic was horrific and we were coming from the other side of town in the north part of jerusalem
when we got there 20 minutes later we started cpr on the kid
a doctor comes in from a block away stop us checks the kid and tells us to stop cpr
that second he declared this child dead
at that moment i understood that this child died for nothing
if this doctor who lived one block away from there would have come 20 minutes earlier not have to wait until that siren he heard before coming from the ambulance if he would have heard about it way before he would have saved this child
he could have run from a block away
he could have saved this child
i said to myself there must be a better way
together with 15 of my friends we were all emts we decided let 's protect our neighborhood so when something like that happens again we will be there running to the scene a lot before the ambulance
so i went over to the manager of the ambulance company and i told him please whenever you have a call coming into our neighborhood we have 15 great guys who are willing to stop everything they 're doing and run and save lives
just alert us by beeper
we 'll buy these beepers just tell your dispatch to send us the beeper and we will run and save lives
well he was laughing i was 17 years old i was a kid
and he said to me i remember this like yesterday he was a great guy but he said to me kid go to school or go open a falafel stand
we 're not really interested in these kinds of new adventures
we 're not interested in your help and he threw me out of the room
i don 't need your help he said
i was a very stubborn kid
as you see now i 'm walking around like crazy meshugenah
so i decided to use the israeli very famous technique you 've probably all heard of chutzpah
and the next day i went and i bought two police scanners and i said the hell with you if you don 't want to give me information i 'll get the information myself
and we did turns who 's going to listen to the radio scanners
the next day while i was listening to the scanners i heard about a call coming in of a 70-year-old man hurt by a car only one block away from me on the main street of my neighborhood
i ran there by foot i had no medical equipment
when i got there the 70-year-old man was lying on the floor blood was gushing out of his neck
he was on coumadin
i knew i had to stop his bleeding or else he would die
i took off my yarmulke because i had no medical equipment and with a lot of pressure i stopped his bleeding
he was bleeding from his neck
when the ambulance arrived 15 minutes later i gave them over a patient who was alive
when i went to visit him two days later he gave me a hug and was crying and thanking me for saving his life
at that moment when i realized this is the first person i ever saved in my life after two years volunteering in an ambulance i knew this is my life 's mission
so today 22 years later we have united hatzalah
hatzalah means rescue for all of you who don 't know hebrew
i forgot i 'm not in israel
so we have thousands of volunteers who are passionate about saving lives and they 're spread all around so whenever a call comes in they just stop everything and go and run and save a life
our average response time today went down to less than three minutes in israel
i 'm talking about heart attacks i 'm talking about car accidents god forbid bomb attacks shootings whatever it is even a woman 3 o 'clock in the morning falling in her home and needs someone to help her
three minutes we 'll have a guy with his pajamas running to her house and helping her get up
the reasons why we 're so successful are because of three things
thousands of passionate volunteers who will leave everything they do and run to help people they don 't even know
we 're not there to replace ambulances
we 're just there to get the gap between the ambulance call until they arrive
and we save people that otherwise would not be saved
the second reason is because of our technology
you know israelis are good in technology
every one of us has on his phone no matter what kind of phone a gps technology done by nowforce and whenever a call comes in the closest five volunteers get the call and they actually get there really quick and navigated by a traffic navigator to get there and not waste time
and this is a great technology we use all over the country and reduce the response time
and the third thing are these ambucycles
these ambucycles are an ambulance on two wheels
we don 't transfer people but we stabilize them and we save their lives
they never get stuck in traffic they could even go on a sidewalk
they never literally get stuck in traffic
that 's why we get there so fast
a few years after i started this organization in a jewish community two muslims from east jerusalem called me up
they ask me to meet they wanted to meet with me
muhammad asli and murad alyan
when muhammad told me his personal story how his father 55 years old collapsed at home had a cardiac arrest and it took over an hour for an ambulance arrive and he saw his father die in front of his eyes he asked me please start this in east jerusalem
i said to myself i saw so much tragedy so much hate and it 's not about saving jews it 's not about saving muslims
it 's not about saving christians it 's about saving people
so i went ahead full force and i started united hatzalah in east jerusalem and that 's why the names united and hatzalah match so well
we started hand in hand saving jews and arabs
arabs were saving jews jews were saving arabs
something special happened
arabs and jews they don 't always get along together but here in this situation the communities literally it 's an unbelievable situation that happened the diversities all of a sudden they had a common interest let 's save lives together
settlers were saving arabs and arabs were saving settlers
it 's an unbelievable concept that could work only when you have such a great cause
and these are all volunteers
no one is getting money
they 're all doing it for the purpose of saving lives
when my own father collapsed a few years ago from a cardiac arrest one of the first volunteers to arrive to save my father was one of these muslim volunteers from east jerusalem who was in the first course to join hatzalah
and he saved my father
could you imagine how i felt in that moment
when i started this organization i was 17 years old
i never imagined that one day i 'd be speaking at tedmed
i never even knew what tedmed was then
i don 't think it existed but i never imagined i never imagined that it 's going to go all around it 's going to spread around and this last year we started in panama and brazil
all i need is a partner who is a little meshugenah like me passionate about saving lives and willing to do it
and i 'm actually starting it in india very soon with a friend who i met in harvard just a while back
hatzalah actually started in brooklyn by a hasidic jew years before us in williamsburg and now it 's all over the jewish community in new york even australia and mexico and many other jewish communities
but it could spread everywhere
it 's very easy to adopt
you even saw these volunteers in new york saving lives in the world trade center
last year alone we treated in israel 207,000 people
forty-two thousand of them were life-threatening situations
and we made a difference
i guess you could call this a lifesaving flash mob and it works
when i look all around here i see lots of people who would go an extra mile run an extra mile to save other people no matter who they are no matter what religion no matter who where they come from
we all want to be heroes
we just need a good idea motivation and lots of chutzpah and we could save millions of people that otherwise would not be saved
thank you very much
i 'm going to tell you about one of the world 's largest problems and how it can be solved
i 'd like to start with a little experiment
could you put your hand up if you wear glasses or contact lenses or you 've had laser refractive surgery
now unfortunately there are too many of you for me to do the statistics properly
but it looks like i 'm guessing that it 'll be about 60 percent of the room because that 's roughly the fraction of developed world population that have some sort of vision correction
the world health organization estimates well they make various estimates of the number of people who need glasses the lowest estimate is 150 million people
they also have an estimate of around a billion
but in fact i would argue that we 've just done an experiment here and now which shows us that the global need for corrective eyewear is around half of any population
and the problem of poor vision is actually not just a health problem it 's also an educational problem and it 's an economic problem and it 's a quality of life problem
glasses are not very expensive they 're quite plentiful
the problem is there aren 't enough eye care professionals in the world to use the model of the delivery of corrective eyewear that we have in the developed world
there are just way too few eye care professionals
so this little slide here shows you an optometrist and the little blue person represents about 10,000 people and that 's the ratio in the u.k.
this is the ratio of optometrists to people in sub-saharan africa
in fact there are some countries in sub-saharan africa where there 's one optometrist for eight million of the population
how do you do this how do you solve this problem
i came up with a solution to this problem and i came up with a solution based on adaptive optics for this
and the idea is you make eye glasses and you adjust them yourself and that solves the problem
what i want to do is to show you that one can make a pair of glasses
i shall just show you how you make a pair of glasses i shall pop this in my pocket
i 'm short sighted i look at the signs at the end i can hardly see them
so okay i can now see that man running out there and i can see that guy running out there
i 've now made prescription eyewear to my prescription
next step in my process
so i 've now made eye glasses to my prescription
okay so i 've made these glasses and ...
okay i 've made the glasses to my prescription and ...
... i 've just ...
and i 've now made some glasses that 's it
now these aren 't the only pair in the world
in fact this technology 's been evolving
i started working on it in 1985 and it 's been evolving very slowly
there are about 30,000 in use now
and they 're in fifteen countries they 're spread around the world
and i have a vision which i 'll share with you
i have a global vision for vision
and that vision is to try to get a billion people wearing the glasses they need by the year 2020
to do that this is an early example of the technology
the technology is being further developed the cost has to be brought down
this pair in fact these currently cost about 19 dollars
but the cost has to be brought right down
it has to be brought down because we 're trying to serve populations who live on a dollar a day
how do you solve this problem
you start to get into detail
and on this slide i 'm basically explaining all the problems you have
how do you distribute how do you work out how to fit the thing
how do you have people realizing that they have a vision problem
how do you deal with the industry
and the answer to that is research
what we 've done is to set up the center for vision in the developing world here in the university
if you want to know more just come have a look at our website thank you
take a look at this drawing
can you tell what it is
i 'm a molecular biologist by training and i 've seen a lot of these kinds of drawings
they 're usually referred to as a model figure a drawing that shows how we think a cellular or molecular process occurs
this particular drawing is of a process called clathrin-mediated endocytosis
it 's a process by which a molecule can get from the outside of the cell to the inside by getting captured in a bubble or a vesicle that then gets internalized by the cell
there 's a problem with this drawing though and it 's mainly in what it doesn 't show
from lots of experiments from lots of different scientists we know a lot about what these molecules look like how they move around in the cell and that this is all taking place in an incredibly dynamic environment
so in collaboration with a clathrin expert tomas kirchhausen we decided to create a new kind of model figure that showed all of that
so we start outside of the cell
now we 're looking inside
clathrin are these three-legged molecules that can self-assemble into soccer-ball-like shapes
through connections with a membrane clathrin is able to deform the membrane and form this sort of a cup that forms this sort of a bubble or a vesicle that 's now capturing some of the proteins that were outside of the cell
proteins are coming in now that basically pinch off this vesicle making it separate from the rest of the membrane and now clathrin is basically done with its job and so proteins are coming in now we 've covered them yellow and orange that are responsible for taking apart this clathrin cage
and so all of these proteins can get basically recycled and used all over again
these processes are too small to be seen directly even with the best microscopes so animations like this provide a really powerful way of visualizing a hypothesis
here 's another illustration and this is a drawing of how a researcher might think that the hiv virus gets into and out of cells
and again this is a vast oversimplification and doesn 't begin to show what we actually know about these processes
you might be surprised to know that these simple drawings are the only way that most biologists visualize their molecular hypotheses
why
because creating movies of processes as we think they actually occur is really hard
i spent months in hollywood learning 3d animation software and i spend months on each animation and that 's just time that most researchers can 't afford
the payoffs can be huge though
molecular animations are unparalleled in their ability to convey a great deal of information to broad audiences with extreme accuracy
and i 'm working on a new project now called the science of hiv where i 'll be animating the entire life cycle of the hiv virus as accurately as possible and all in molecular detail
the animation will feature data from thousands of researchers collected over decades data on what this virus looks like how it 's able to infect cells in our body and how therapeutics are helping to combat infection
over the years i found that animations aren 't just useful for communicating an idea but they 're also really useful for exploring a hypothesis
biologists for the most part are still using a paper and pencil to visualize the processes they study and with the data we have now that 's just not good enough anymore
the process of creating an animation can act as a catalyst that allows researchers to crystalize and refine their own ideas
one researcher i worked with who works on the molecular mechanisms of neurodegenerative diseases came up with experiments that were related directly to the animation that she and i worked on together and in this way animation can feed back into the research process
i believe that animation can change biology
it can change the way that we communicate with one another how we explore our data and how we teach our students
but for that change to happen we need more researchers creating animations and toward that end i brought together a team of biologists animators and programmers to create a new free open-source software we call it molecular flipbook that 's created just for biologists just to create molecular animations
from our testing we 've found that it only takes 15 minutes for a biologist who has never touched animation software before to create her first molecular animation of her own hypothesis
we 're also building an online database where anyone can view download and contribute their own animations
we 're really excited to announce that the beta version of the molecular animation software toolkit will be available for download today
we are really excited to see what biologists will create with it and what new insights they 're able to gain from finally being able to animate their own model figures
thank you
i 'm a filmmaker
for the last 8 years i have dedicated my life to documenting the work of israelis and palestinians who are trying to end the conflict using peaceful means
when i travel with my work across europe and the united states one question always comes up where is the palestinian gandhi
why aren 't palestinians using nonviolent resistance
the challenge i face when i hear this question is that often i have just returned from the middle east where i spent my time filming dozens of palestinians who are using nonviolence to defend their lands and water resources from israeli soldiers and settlers
these leaders are trying to forge a massive national nonviolent movement to end the occupation and build peace in the region
yet most of you have probably never heard about them
this divide between what 's happening on the ground and perceptions abroad is one of the key reasons why we don 't have yet a palestinian peaceful resistance movement that has been successful
so i 'm here today to talk about the power of attention the power of your attention and the emergence and development of nonviolent movements in the west bank gaza and elsewhere but today my case study is going to be palestine
i believe that what 's mostly missing for nonviolence to grow is not for palestinians to start adopting nonviolence but for us to start paying attention to those who already are
allow me to illustrate this point by taking you to this village called budrus
about seven years ago they faced extinction because israel announced it would build a separation barrier and part of this barrier would be built on top of the village
they would lose 40 percent of their land and be surrounded so they would lose free access to the rest of the west bank
through inspired local leadership they launched a peaceful resistance campaign to stop that from happening
let me show you some brief clips so you have a sense for what that actually looked like on the ground
palestinian we were told the wall would separate palestine from israel
here in budrus we realized the wall would steal our land
israeli the fence has in fact created a solution to terror
today you 're invited to a peaceful march
you are joined by dozens of your israeli brothers and sisters
israeli activist nothing scares the army more than nonviolent opposition
we saw the men trying to push the soldiers but none of them could do that
but i think the girls could do it
fatah party member we must empty our minds of traditional thinking
hamas party member we were in complete harmony and we wanted to spread it to all of palestine
chanting one united nation
fatah hamas and the popular front
news anchor the clashes over the fence continue
reporter israeli border police were sent to disperse the crowd
they were allowed to use any force necessary
these are live bullets
it 's like fallujah shooting everywhere
israeli activist i was sure we were all going to die
but there were others around me who weren 't even cowering
israeli a nonviolent protest is not going to stop the [ unclear ]
protester this is a peaceful march
there is no need to use violence
chanting we can do it we can do it
we can do it
julia bacha when i first heard about the story of budrus i was surprised that the international media had failed to cover the extraordinary set of events that happened seven years ago in 2003
what was even more surprising was the fact that budrus was successful
the residents after 10 months of peaceful resistance convinced the israeli government to move the route of the barrier off their lands and to the green line which is the internationally recognized boundary between israel and the palestinian territories
the resistance in budrus has since spread to villages across the west bank and to palestinian neighborhoods in jerusalem
yet the media remains mostly silent on these stories
this silence carries profound consequences for the likelihood that nonviolence can grow or even survive in palestine
violent resistance and nonviolent resistance share one very important thing in common they are both a form of theater seeking an audience to their cause
if violent actors are the only ones constantly getting front-page covers and attracting international attention to the palestinian issue it becomes very hard for nonviolent leaders to make the case to their communities that civil disobedience is a viable option in addressing their plight
the power of attention is probably going to come as no surprise to the parents in the room
the surest way to make your child throw increasingly louder tantrums is by giving him attention the first time he throws a fit
the tantrum will become what childhood psychologists call a functional behavior since the child has learned that he can get parental attention out of it
parents can incentivize or disincentivize behavior simply by giving or withdrawing attention to their children
but that 's true for adults too
in fact the behavior of entire communities and countries can be influenced depending on where the international community chooses to focus its attention
i believe that at the core of ending the conflict in the middle east and bringing peace is for us to transform nonviolence into a functional behavior by giving a lot more attention to the nonviolent leaders on the ground today
in the course of taking my film to villages in the west bank in gaza and in east jerusalem i have seen the impact that even one documentary film can have in influencing the transformation
in a village called wallajeh which sits very close to jerusalem the community was facing a very similar plight to budrus
they were going to be surrounded lose a lot of their lands and not have freedom of access either to the west bank or jerusalem
they had been using nonviolence for about two years but had grown disenchanted since nobody was paying attention
so we organized a screening
a week later they held the most well-attended and disciplined demonstration to date
the organizers say that the villagers upon seeing the story of budrus documented in a film felt that there were indeed people following what they were doing that people cared
so they kept on going
on the israeli side there is a new peace movement called solidariot which means solidarity in hebrew
the leaders of this movement have been using budrus as one of their primary recruiting tools
they report that israelis who had never been active before upon seeing the film understand the power of nonviolence and start joining their activities
the examples of wallajeh and the solidariot movement show that even a small-budget independent film can play a role in transforming nonviolence into a functional behavior
now imagine the power that big media players could have if they started covering the weekly nonviolent demonstrations happening in villages like bil 'in ni 'lin wallajeh in jerusalem neighborhoods like sheikh jarrah and silwan the nonviolent leaders would become more visible valued and effective in their work
i believe that the most important thing is to understand that if we don 't pay attention to these efforts they are invisible and it 's as if they never happened
but i have seen first hand that if we do they will multiply
if they multiply their influence will grow in the overall israeli-palestinian conflict
and theirs is the kind of influence that can finally unblock the situation
these leaders have proven that nonviolence works in places like budrus
let 's give them attention so they can prove it works everywhere
thank you

i 'm going to give you four specific examples and i 'm going to cover at the end about how a company called silk tripled their sales by doing one thing how an artist named jeff koons went from being a nobody to making a whole bunch of money and having a lot of impact to how frank gehry redefined what it meant to be an architect
and one of my biggest failures as a marketer in the last few years a record label i started that had a cd called sauce
before i can do that i 've got to tell you about sliced bread and a guy named otto rohwedder
now before sliced bread was invented in the 1910s i wonder what they said
like the greatest invention since ... the telegraph or something
but this guy named otto rohwedder invented sliced bread and he focused like most inventors did on the patent part and the making part
and the thing about the invention of sliced bread is this that for the first 15 years after sliced bread was available no one bought it no one knew about it it was a complete and total failure
and the reason is that until wonder came along and figured out how to spread the idea of sliced bread no one wanted it
that the success of sliced bread like the success of almost everything we 've been talking about at this conference is not always about what the patent is like or what the factory is like it 's about can you get your idea to spread or not
and i think that the way you 're going to get what you want or cause the change that you want to change to happen is that you 've got to figure out a way to get your ideas to spread
and it doesn 't matter to me whether you 're running a coffee shop or you 're an intellectual or you 're in business or you 're flying hot air balloons
i think that all this stuff applies to everybody regardless of what we do
that what we are living in is a century of idea diffusion
that people who can spread ideas regardless of what those ideas are win
and when i talk about it i usually pick business because they make the best pictures that you can put in your presentation and because it 's the easiest sort of way to keep score
but i want you to forgive me when i use these examples because i 'm talking about anything that you decide to spend your time to do
at the heart of spreading ideas is tv and stuff like tv
tv and mass media made it really easy to spread ideas in a certain way
i call it the tv-industrial complex
the way the tv-industrial complex works is you buy some ads interrupt some people that gets you distribution
you use the distribution you get to sell more products
you take the profit from that to buy more ads
and it goes around and around and around the same way that military-industrial complex worked a long time ago
and that model of and we heard it yesterday if we could only get onto the homepage of google if we could only figure out how to get promoted there if we could only figure out how to grab that person by the throat and tell them about what we want to do
if we do that then everyone would pay attention and we would win
well this tv-industrial complex informed my entire childhood and probably yours
i mean all of these products succeeded because someone figured out how to touch people in a way they weren 't expecting in a way they didn 't necessarily want with an ad over and over and over again until they bought it
and the thing that 's happened is they canceled the tv-industrial complex
that just over the last few years what anybody who markets anything has discovered is that it 's not working the way that it used to
this picture is really fuzzy i apologize i had a bad cold when i took it
but the product in the blue box in the center is my poster child
right i go to the deli i 'm sick i need to buy some medicine
the brand manager for that blue product spent 100 million dollars trying to interrupt me in one year
100 million dollars interrupting me with tv commercials and magazine ads and spam and coupons and shelving allowances and spiff all so i could ignore every single message
and i ignored every message because i don 't have a pain reliever problem
i buy the stuff in the yellow box because i always have
and i 'm not going to invest a minute of my time to solve her problem because i don 't care
here 's a magazine called hydrate it 's 180 pages about water
right articles about water ads about water
imagine what the world was like 40 years ago when it was just the saturday evening post and time and newsweek
now there are magazines about water
new products from coke japan water salad
ok coke japan comes out with a new product every three weeks because they have no idea what 's going to work and what 's not
i couldn 't have written this better myself it came out four days ago i circled the important parts so you can see them here
they 've come out ... arby 's is going to spend 85 million dollars promoting an oven mitt with the voice of tom arnold hoping that that will get people to go to arby 's and buy a roast beef sandwich
now i had tried to imagine what could possibly be in an animated tv commercial featuring tom arnold that would get you to get in your car drive across town and buy a roast beef sandwich
now this is copernicus and he was right when he was talking to anyone who needs to hear your idea
the world revolves around me me me me me me my favorite person me
i don 't want to get email from anybody i want to get memail
so consumers and i don 't just mean people who buy stuff at the safeway i mean people at the defense department who might buy something or people at you know the new yorker who might print your article
consumers don 't care about you at all they just don 't care
part of the reason is they 've got way more choices than they used to and way less time
and in a world where we have too many choices and too little time the obvious thing to do is just ignore stuff
and my parable here is you 're driving down the road and you see a cow and you keep driving because you 've seen cows before
cows are invisible cows are boring
who 's going to stop and pull over and say oh look a cow nobody
but if the cow was purple isn 't that a great special effect
i could do that again if you want it
if the cow was purple you 'd notice it for a while
i mean if all cows were purple you 'd get bored with those too
the thing that 's going to decide what gets talked about what gets done what gets changed what gets purchased what gets built is is it remarkable
and remarkable is a really cool word because we think it just means neat but it also means worth making a remark about
and that is the essence of where idea diffusion is going
that two of the hottest cars in the united states is a 55,000-dollar giant car big enough to hold a mini in its trunk
people are paying full price for both and the only thing they have in common is that they don 't have anything in common
every week the number one best-selling dvd in america changes
it 's never the godfather it 's never citizen kane it 's always some third rate movie with some second rate star
but the reason it 's number one is because that 's the week it came out
because it 's new because it 's fresh
because people saw it and said i didn 't know that was there and they noticed it
two of the big success stories of the last 20 years in retail one sells things that are super-expensive in a blue box and one sells things that are as cheap as they can make them
the only thing they have in common is that they 're different
we 're now in the fashion business no matter what we do for a living we 're in the fashion business
and the thing is people in the fashion business know what it 's like to be in the fashion business they 're used to it
the rest of us have to figure out how to think that way
how to understand that it 's not about interrupting people with big full-page ads or insisting on meetings with people
but it 's a totally different sort of process that determines which ideas spread and which ones don 't
this chair they sold a billion dollars worth of aeron chairs by reinventing what it meant to sell a chair
they turned a chair from something the purchasing department bought to something that was a status symbol about where you sat at work
this guy lionel poilane the most famous baker in the world he died two and a half months ago and he was a hero of mine and a dear friend
he lived in paris last year he sold 10 million dollars worth of french bread
every loaf baked in a bakery he owned by one baker at a time in a wood-fired oven
and when lionel started his bakery the french pooh-pooh-ed it
they didn 't want to buy his bread it didn 't look like french bread
it wasn 't what they expected
it was neat it was remarkable and slowly it spread from one person to another person until finally it became the official bread of three-star restaurants in paris
now he 's in london and he ships by fedex all around the world
what marketers used to do is make average products for average people
that 's what mass marketing is
smooth out the edges go for the center that 's the big market
they would ignore the geeks and god forbid the laggards
it was all about going for the center
but in a world where the tv-industrial complex is broken i don 't think that 's a strategy we want to use any more
i think the strategy we want to use is to not market to these people because they 're really good at ignoring you
but market to these people because they care
these are the people who are obsessed with something
and when you talk to them they 'll listen because they like listening it 's about them
and if you 're lucky they 'll tell their friends on the rest of the curve and it 'll spread
it 'll spread to the entire curve
they have something i call otaku it 's a great japanese word
it describes the desire of someone who 's obsessed to say drive across tokyo to try a new ramen noodle place because that 's what they do they get obsessed with it
to make a product to market an idea to come up with any problem you want to solve that doesn 't have a constituency with an otaku is almost impossible
instead you have to find a group that really desperately cares about what it is you have to say
talk to them and make it easy for them to tell their friends
there 's a hot sauce otaku but there 's no mustard otaku
that 's why there 's lots and lots and lots of kinds of hot sauces and not so many kinds of mustard
not because it 's hard to make interesting mustard you can make interesting mustard but people don 't because no one 's obsessed with it and thus no one tells their friends
krispy kreme has figured this whole thing out
krispy kreme has a strategy and what they do is they enter a city they talk to the people with otaku and then they spread through the city to the people who 've just crossed the street
this yoyo right here cost 112 dollars but it sleeps for 12 minutes
not everybody wants it but they don 't care
they want to talk to the people who do and maybe it 'll spread
these guys make the loudest car stereo in the world
it 's as loud as a 747 jet you can 't get in the car it 's got bulletproof glass on the windows because they 'll blow out the windshield otherwise
but the fact remains that when someone wants to put a couple of speakers in their car if they 've got the otaku or they 've heard from someone who does they go ahead and they pick this
it 's really simple you sell to the people who are listening and maybe just maybe those people tell their friends
so when steve jobs talks to 50,000 people at his keynote right who are all tuned in from 130 countries watching his two-hour commercial that 's the only thing keeping his company in business is that those 50,000 people care desperately enough to watch a two-hour commercial and then tell their friends
pearl jam 96 albums released in the last two years
every one made a profit how
they only sell them on their website
those people who buy them on the website have the otaku and then they tell their friends and it spreads and it spreads
this hospital crib cost 10,000 dollars 10 times the standard
but hospitals are buying it faster than any other model
hard candy nail polish doesn 't appeal to everybody but to the people who love it they talk about it like crazy
this paint can right here saved the dutch boy paint company making them a fortune it costs 35 percent more than regular paint because dutch boy made a can that people talk about because it 's remarkable
they didn 't just slap a new ad on the product they changed what it meant to build a paint product
amihotornot.com everyday 250,000 people go to this site run by two volunteers and i can tell you they are hard graders and they didn 't get this way by advertising a lot
they got this way by being remarkable sometimes a little too remarkable
and this picture frame has a cord going out the back and you plug it into the wall
my father has this on his desk and he sees his grandchildren everyday changing constantly
and every single person who walks into his office hears the whole story of how this thing ended up on his desk
and one person at a time the idea spreads
these are not diamonds not really
they 're made from cremains
after you 're cremated you can have yourself made into a gem
oh you like my ring it 's my grandmother
fastest-growing business in the whole mortuary industry
but you don 't have to be ozzie osborne you don 't have to be super-outrageous to do this
what you have to do is figure out what people really want and give it to them
a couple of quick rules to wrap up
the first one is design is free when you get to scale
and the people who come up with stuff that 's remarkable more often than not figure out how to put design to work for them
number two the riskiest thing you can do now is be safe
proctor and gamble knows this right
the whole model of being proctor and gamble is always about average products for average people
that 's risky the safe thing to do now is to be at the fringes be remarkable
and being very good is one of the worst things you can possibly do
very good is boring very good is average
it doesn 't matter whether you 're making a record album or you 're an architect or you have a tract on sociology
if it 's very good it 's not going to work because no one 's going to notice it
so my three stories
silk put a product that does not need to be in the refrigerated section next to the milk in the refrigerated section
sales tripled why
milk milk milk milk milk not milk
for the people who were there and looking at that section it was remarkable
they didn 't triple their sales with advertising they tripled it by doing something remarkable
that is a remarkable piece of art you don 't have to like it but a 40-foot tall dog made out of bushes in the middle of new york city is remarkable
frank gehry didn 't just change a museum he changed an entire city 's economy by designing one building that people from all over the world went to see
now at countless meetings at you know the portland city council or who knows where they said we need an architect can we get frank gehry
because he did something that was at the fringes
and my big failure i came out with an entire record album and hopefully a whole bunch of record albums in sacd format this remarkable new format and i marketed it straight to people with 20,000-dollar stereos
people with 20,000-dollar stereos don 't like new music
so what you need to do is figure out who does care
who is going to raise their hand and say i want to hear what you 're doing next and sell something to them
the last example i want to give you
this is a map of soap lake washington
as you can see if that 's nowhere it 's in the middle of it
but they do have a lake
and people used to come from miles around to swim in the lake
they don 't anymore so the founding fathers said we 've got some money to spend
what can we build here and like most committees they were going to build something pretty safe
and then an artist came to them this is a true artist 's rendering he wants to build a 55-foot tall lava lamp in the center of town
that 's a purple cow that 's something worth noticing
i don 't know about you but if they build it that 's where i 'm going to go
thank you very much for your attention
as a culture we tell ourselves lots of stories about the future and where we might move forward from this point
some of those stories are that somebody is just going to sort everything out for us
other stories are that everything is on the verge of unraveling
but i want to tell you a different story here today
like all stories it has a beginning
my work for a long time has been involved in education in teaching people practical skills for sustainability teaching people how to take responsibility for growing some of their own food how to build buildings using local materials how to generate their own energy and so on
i lived in ireland built the first straw-bale houses in ireland and some cob buildings and all this kind of thing
but all my work for many years was focused around the idea that sustainability means basically looking at the globalized economic growth model and moderating what comes in at one end and moderating the outputs at the other end
and then i came into contact with a way of looking at things which actually changed that profoundly
and in order to introduce you to that i 've got something here that i 'm going to unveil which is one of the great marvels of the modern age
and it 's something so astounding and so astonishing that i think maybe as i remove this cloth a suitable gasp of amazement might be appropriate
if you could help me with that it would be fantastic
this is a liter of oil
this bottle of oil distilled over a hundred million years of geological time ancient sunlight contains the energy equivalent of about five weeks hard human manual labor equivalent to about 35 strong people coming round and working for you
we can turn it into a dazzling array of materials medicine modern clothing laptops a whole range of different things
it gives us an energy return that 's unimaginable historically
we 've based the design of our settlements our business models our transport plans even the idea of economic growth some would argue on the assumption that we will have this in perpetuity
yet when we take a step back and look over the span of history at what we might call the petroleum interval it 's a short period in history where we 've discovered this extraordinary material and then based a whole way of life around it
but as we straddle the top of this energy mountain at this stage we move from a time where our economic success our sense of individual prowess and well-being is directly linked to how much of this we consume to a time when actually our degree of oil dependency is our degree of vulnerability
and it 's increasingly clear that we aren 't going to be able to rely on the fact that we 're going to have this at our disposal forever
for every four barrels of oil that we consume we only discover one
and that gap continues to widen
there is also the fact that the amount of energy that we get back from the oil that we discover is falling
in the 1930s we got 100 units of energy back for every one that we put in to extract it
completely unprecedented historically
already that 's fallen to about 11
and that 's why now the new breakthroughs the new frontiers in terms of oil extraction are scrambling about in alberta or at the bottom of the oceans
there are 98 oil-producing nations in the world
but of those 65 have already passed their peak
the moment when the world on average passes this peak people wonder when that 's going to happen
and there is an emerging case that maybe that was what happened last july when the oil prices were so high
but are we to assume that the same brilliance and creativity and adaptability that got us up to the top of that energy mountain in the first place is somehow mysteriously going to evaporate when we have to design a creative way back down the other side
no but the thinking that we have to come up with has to be based on a realistic assessment of where we are
there is also the issue of climate change is the other thing that underpins this transition approach
but the thing that i notice as i talk to climate scientists is the increasingly terrified look they have in their eyes as the data that 's coming in which is far ahead of what the ipcc are talking about
so the ipcc said that we might see significant breakup of the arctic ice in 2100 in their worst case scenario
actually if current trends continue it could all be gone in five or 10 years time
if just three percent of the carbon locked up in the arctic permafrost is released as the world warms it would offset all the savings that we need to make in carbon over the next 40 years to avoid runaway climate change
we have no choice other than deep and urgent decarbonization
but i 'm always very interested to think about what might the stories be that the generations further down the slope from us are going to tell about us
the generation that lived at the top of the mountain that partied so hard and so abused its inheritance
and one of the ways i like to do that is to look back at the stories people used to tell before we had cheap oil before we had fossil fuels and people relied on their own muscle animal muscle energy or a little bit of wind little bit of water energy
we had stories like the seven-league boots the giant who had these boots where once you put them on with every stride you could cover seven leagues or 21 miles a kind of travel completely unimaginable to people without that kind of energy at their disposal
stories like the magic porridge pot where you had a pot where if you knew the magic words this pot would just make as much food as you liked without you having to do any work provided you could remember the other magic word to stop it making porridge
otherwise you 'd flood your entire town with warm porridge
there is the story of the elves and the shoemaker
the people who make shoes go to sleep wake up in the morning and all the shoes are magically made for them
it 's something that was unimaginable to people then
now we have the seven-league boots in the form of ryanair and easyjet
we have the magic porridge pot in the form of walmart and tesco
and we have the elves in the form of china
but we don 't appreciate what an astonishing thing that has been
and what are the stories that we tell ourselves now as we look forward about where we 're going to go
and i would argue that there are four there is the idea of business as usual that the future will be like the present just more of it
but as we 've seen over the last year i think that 's an idea that is increasingly coming into question
and in terms of climate change is something that is not actually feasible
there is the idea of hitting the wall that actually somehow everything is so fragile that it might just all unravel and collapse
this is a popular story in some places
the third story is the idea that technology can solve everything that technology can somehow get us through this completely
and it 's an idea that i think is very prevalent at these ted talks the idea that we can invent our way out of a profound economic and energy crisis that a move to a knowledge economy can somehow neatly sidestep those energy constraints the idea that we 'll discover some fabulous new source of energy that will mean we can sweep all concerns about energy security to one side the idea that we can step off neatly onto a completely renewable world
but the world isn 't second life
we can 't create new land and new energy systems at the click of a mouse
and as we sit exchanging free ideas with each other there are still people mining coal in order to power the servers extracting the minerals to make all of those things
the breakfast that we eat as we sit down to check our email in the morning is still transported at great distances usually at the expense of the local more resilient food systems that would have supplied that in the past which we 've so effectively devalued and dismantled
we can be astonishingly inventive and creative
but we also live in a world with very real constraints and demands
energy and technology are not the same thing
what i 'm involved with is the transition response
and this is really about looking the challenges of peak oil and climate change square in the face and responding with a creativity and an adaptability and an imagination that we really need
it 's something which has spread incredibly fast
and it is something which has several characteristics
it 's viral it seems to spread under the radar very very quickly
it 's open source it 's something which everybody who 's involved with it develops and passes on as they work with it
it 's self-organizing there is no great central organization that pushes this people just pick up an idea and they run with it and they implement it where they are
it 's solutions-focused it 's very much looking at what people can do where they are to respond to this
it 's sensitive to place and to scale
transitional is completely different
transition groups in chile transition groups in the u.s. transition groups here what they 're doing looks very different in every place that you go to
it learns very much from its mistakes
and it feels historic it tries to create a sense that this is a historic opportunity to do something really extraordinary
and it 's a process which is really joyful
people have a huge amount of fun doing this reconnecting with other people as they do it
one of the things that underpins it is this idea of resilience
and i think in many ways the idea of resilience is a more useful concept than the idea of sustainability
the idea of resilience comes from the study of ecology
and it 's really about how systems settlements withstand shock from the outside
when they encounter shock from the outside that they don 't just unravel and fall to pieces
and i think it 's a more useful concept than sustainability as i said
when our supermarkets have only two or three days worth of food in them at any one time often sustainability tends to focus on the energy efficiency of the freezers and on the packaging that the lettuces are wrapped up in
looking through the lens of resilience we really question how we 've let ourselves get into a situation that 's so vulnerable
resilience runs much deeper it 's about building modularity into what we do building surge breakers into how we organize the basic things that support us
this is a photograph of the bristol and district market gardeners association in 1897
this is at a time when the city of bristol which is quite close to here was surrounded by commercial market gardens which provided a significant amount of the food that was consumed in the town and created a lot of employment for people as well
there was a degree of resilience if you like at that time which we can now only look back on with envy
so how does this transition idea work
so basically you have a group of people who are excited by the idea
they pick up some of the tools that we 've developed
they start to run an awareness-raising program looking at how this might actually work in the town
they show films they give talks and so on
it 's a process which is playful and creative and informative
then they start to form working groups looking at different aspects of this and then from that there emerge a whole lot of projects which then the transition project itself starts to support and enable
so it started out with some work i was involved in in ireland where i was teaching and has since spread
there are now over 200 formal transition projects
and there are thousands of others who are at what we call the mulling stage
they are mulling whether they 're going to take it further
and actually a lot of them are doing huge amounts of stuff
but what do they actually do you know it 's a kind of nice idea but what do they actually do on the ground
well i think it 's really important to make the point that actually you know this isn 't something which is going to do everything on its own
we need international legislation from copenhagen and so on
we need national responses we need local government responses
but all of those things are going to be much easier if we have communities that are vibrant and coming up with ideas and leading from the front making unelectable policies electable over the next 5 to 10 years
some of the things that emerge from it are local food projects like community-supported agriculture schemes urban food production creating local food directories and so on
a lot of places now are starting to set up their own energy companies community-owned energy companies where the community can invest money into itself to start putting in place the kind of renewable energy infrastructure that we need
a lot of places are working with their local schools
newent in the forest of dean big polytunnel they built for the school the kids are learning how to grow food
promoting recycling things like garden-share that matches up people who don 't have a garden who would like to grow food with people who have gardens they aren 't using anymore
planting productive trees throughout urban spaces
and also starting to play around with the idea of alternative currencies
this is lewes in sussex who have recently launched the lewes pound a currency that you can only spend within the town as a way of starting to cycle money within the local economy
you take it anywhere else it 's not worth anything
but actually within the town you start to create these economic cycles much more effectively
another thing that they do is what we call an energy descent plan which is basically to develop a plan b for the town
most of our local authorities when they sit down to plan for the next five 10 15 20 years of a community still start by assuming that there will be more energy more cars more housing more jobs more growth and so on
what does it look like if that 's not the case and how can we embrace that and actually come up with something that was actually more likely to sustain everybody
as a friend of mine says life is a series of things you 're not quite ready for
and that 's certainly been my experience with transition
from three years ago it just being an idea this has become something that has virally swept around the world
we 're getting a lot of interest from government ed miliband the energy minister of this country was invited to come to our recent conference as a keynote listener
which he did and has since become a great advocate of the whole idea
there are now two local authorities in this country who have declared themselves transitional local authorities leicestershire and somerset and in stroud the transition group there in effect wrote the local government 's food plan
and the head of the council said if we didn 't have transition stroud we would have to invent all of that community infrastructure for the first time
as we see the spread of it we see national hubs emerging
in scotland the scottish government 's climate change fund has funded transition scotland as a national organization supporting the spread of this
and we see it all over the place as well now
but the key to transition is thinking not that we have to change everything now but that things are already inevitably changing and what we need to do is to work creatively with that based on asking the right questions
i think i 'd like to just return at the end to the idea of stories
because i think stories are vital here
and actually the stories that we tell ourselves we have a huge dearth of stories about how to move forward creatively from here
and one of the key things that transition does is to pull those stories out of what people are doing
stories about the community that 's produced its own 21 pound note for example the school that 's turned its car park into a food garden the community that 's founded its own energy company
and for me one of the great stories recently was the obamas digging up the south lawn of the white house to create a vegetable garden because the last time that was done when eleanor roosevelt did it it led to the creation of 20 million vegetable gardens across the united states
so the question i 'd like to leave you with really is for all aspects of the things that your community needs in order to thrive how can it be done in such a way that drastically reduces its carbon emissions while also building resilience
personally i feel enormously grateful to have lived through the age of cheap oil
i 've been astonishingly lucky we 've been astonishingly lucky
but let us honor what it has bought us and move forward from this point
because if we cling to it and continue to assume that it can underpin our choices the future that it presents to us is one which is really unmanageable
and by loving and leaving all that oil has done for us and that the oil age has done for us we are able to then begin the creation of a world which is more resilient more nourishing and in which we find ourselves fitter more skilled and more connected to each other
thank you very much
people do stupid things
that 's what spreads hiv
this was a headline in a u.k. newspaper the guardian not that long ago
i 'm curious show of hands who agrees with it
well one or two brave souls
this is actually a direct quote from an epidemiologist who 's been in field of hiv for 15 years worked on four continents and you 're looking at her
and i am now going to argue that this is only half true
people do get hiv because they do stupid things but most of them are doing stupid things for perfectly rational reasons
now rational is the dominant paradigm in public health and if you put your public health nerd glasses on you 'll see that if we give people the information that they need about what 's good for them and what 's bad for them if you give them the services that they can use to act on that information and a little bit of motivation people will make rational decisions and live long and healthy lives
wonderful
that 's slightly problematic for me because i work in hiv and although i 'm sure you all know that hiv is about poverty and gender inequality and if you were at ted 07 it 's about coffee prices ...
actually hiv 's about sex and drugs and if there are two things that make human beings a little bit irrational they are erections and addiction
so let 's start with what 's rational for an addict
now i remember speaking to an indonesian friend of mine frankie
we were having lunch and he was telling me about when he was in jail in bali for a drug injection
it was someone 's birthday and they had very kindly smuggled some heroin into jail and he was very generously sharing it out with all of his colleagues
and so everyone lined up all the smackheads in a row and the guy whose birthday it was filled up the fit and he went down and started injecting people
so he injects the first guy and then he 's wiping the needle on his shirt and he injects the next guy
and frankie says i 'm number 22 in line and i can see the needle coming down towards me and there is blood all over the place
it 's getting blunter and blunter
and a small part of my brain is thinking that is so gross and really dangerous but most of my brain is thinking please let there be some smack left by the time it gets to me
please let there be some left and then telling me this story frankie said you know ... god drugs really make you stupid
and you know you can 't fault him for accuracy
but actually frankie at that time was a heroin addict and he was in jail
so his choice was either to accept that dirty needle or not to get high
and if there 's one place you really want to get high it 's when you 're in jail
but i 'm a scientist and i don 't like to make data out of anecdotes so let 's look at some data
we talked to 600 drug addicts in three cities in indonesia and we said well do you know how you get hiv
oh yeah by sharing needles
i mean nearly 100 percent yeah by sharing needles
and do you know where you can get a clean needle at a price you can afford to avoid that
oh yeah hundred percent
we 're smackheads we know where to get clean needles
so are you carrying a needle
we 're actually interviewing people on the street in the places where they 're hanging out and taking drugs
are you carrying clean needles
one in four maximum
so no surprises then that the proportion that actually used clean needles every time they injected in the last week is just about one in 10 and the other nine in 10 are sharing
so you 've got this massive mismatch everyone knows that if they share they 're going to get hiv but they 're all sharing anyway
so what 's that about is it like you get a better high if you share or something
we asked that to a junkie and they 're like are you nuts
you don 't want to share a needle anymore than you want to share a toothbrush even with someone you 're sleeping with
there 's just kind of an ick factor there
no no we share needles because we don 't want to go to jail
so in indonesia at this time if you were carrying a needle and the cops rounded you up they could put you into jail
and that changes the equation slightly doesn 't it
because your choice now is either i use my own needle now or i could share a needle now and get a disease that 's going to possibly kill me 10 years from now or i could use my own needle now and go to jail tomorrow
and while junkies think that it 's a really bad idea to expose themselves to hiv they think it 's a much worse idea to spend the next year in jail where they 'll probably end up in frankie 's situation and expose themselves to hiv anyway
so suddenly it becomes perfectly rational to share needles
now let 's look at it from a policy maker 's point of view
this is a really easy problem
for once your incentives are aligned
we 've got what 's rational for public health
you want people to use clean needles and junkies want to use clean needles
so we could make this problem go away simply by making clean needles universally available and taking away the fear of arrest
now the first person to figure that out and do something about it on a national scale was that well-known bleeding heart liberal margaret thatcher
and she put in the world 's first national needle exchange program and other countries followed suit australia the netherlands and few others
and in all of those countries you can see not more than four percent of injectors ever became infected with hiv
now places that didn 't do this new york city for example moscow jakarta we 're talking at its peak one in two injectors infected with this fatal disease
now margaret thatcher didn 't do this because she has any great love for junkies
she did it because she ran a country that had a national health service
so if she didn 't invest in effective prevention she was going to have pick up the costs of treatment later on and obviously those are much higher
so she was making a politically rational decision
now if i take out my public health nerd glasses here and look at these data it seems like a no-brainer doesn 't it
but in this country where the government apparently does not feel compelled to provide health care for citizens we 've taken a very different approach
so what we 've been doing in the united states is reviewing the data endlessly reviewing the data
so these are reviews of hundreds of studies by all the big muckety-mucks of the scientific pantheon in the united states and these are the studies that show needle programs are effective quite a lot of them
now the ones that show that needle programs aren 't effective you think that 's one of these annoying dynamic slides and i 'm going to press my dongle and the rest of it 's going to come up but no that 's the whole slide
there is nothing on the other side
so completely irrational you would think
except that wait a minute politicians are rational too and they 're responding to what they think the voters want
so what we see is that voters respond very well to things like this and not quite so well to things like this
so it becomes quite rational to deny services to injectors
now let 's talk about sex
are we any more rational about sex
well i 'm not even going to address the clearly irrational positions of people like the catholic church who think somehow that if you give out condoms everyone 's going to run out and have sex
i don 't know if pope benedict watches tedtalks online but if you do i 've got news for you benedict i carry condoms all the time and i never get laid
it 's not that easy
here maybe you 'll have better luck
okay seriously hiv is actually not that easy to transmit sexually
so it depends on how much virus there is in your blood and in your body fluids
and what we 've got is a very very high level of virus right at the beginning when you 're first infected then you start making antibodies and then it bumps along at quite low levels for a long time 10 or 12 years you have spikes if you get another sexually transmitted infection
but basically nothing much is going on until you start to get symptomatic aids and by that stage you 're not looking great you 're not feeling great you 're not having that much sex
so the sexual transmission of hiv is essentially determined by how many partners you have in these very short spaces of time when you have peak viremia
now this makes people crazy because it means that you have to talk about some groups having more sexual partners in shorter spaces of time than other groups and that 's considered stigmatizing
i 've always been a bit curious about that because i think stigma is a bad thing whereas lots of sex is quite a good thing but we 'll leave that be
the truth is that 20 years of very good research have shown us that there are groups that are more likely to turnover large numbers of partners in a short space of time
and those groups are globally people who sell sex and their more regular partners
they are gay men on the party scene who have on average three times more partners than straight people on the party scene
and they are heterosexuals who come from countries that have traditions of polygamy and relatively high levels of female autonomy and almost all of those countries are in east or southern africa
and that is reflected in the epidemic that we have today
you can see these horrifying figures from africa
these are all countries in southern africa where between one in seven and one in three of all adults are infected with hiv
now in the rest of the world we 've got basically nothing going on in the general population very very low levels but we have extraordinarily high levels of hiv in these other populations who are at highest risk drug injectors sex workers and gay men
and you 'll note that 's the local data from los angeles 25 percent prevalence among gay men
of course you can 't get hiv just by having unprotected sex
you can only hiv by having unprotected sex with a positive person
in most of the world these few prevention failures notwithstanding we are actually doing quite well these days in commercial sex condom use rates are between 80 and 100 percent in commercial sex in most countries
and again it 's because of an alignment of the incentives
what 's rational for public health is also rational for individual sex workers because it 's really bad for business to have another sti
no one wants it
and actually clients don 't want to go home with a drip either
so essentially you 're able to achieve quite high rates of condom use in commercial sex
but in intimate relations it 's much more difficult because with your wife or your boyfriend or someone that you hope might turn into one of those things we have this illusion of romance and trust and intimacy and nothing is quite so unromantic as the my condom or yours darling question
so in the face of that you really need quite a strong incentive to use condoms
this for example this gentleman is called joseph
he 's from haiti and he has aids
and he 's probably not having a lot of sex right now but he is a reminder in the population of why you might want to be using condoms
this is also in haiti and is a reminder of why you might want to be having sex perhaps
now funnily enough this is also joseph after six months on antiretroviral treatment
not for nothing do we call it the lazarus effect
but it is changing the equation of what 's rational in sexual decision-making
so what we 've got some people say oh it doesn 't matter very much because actually treatment is effective prevention because it lowers your viral load and therefore makes it more difficult to transmit hiv
so if you look at the viremia thing again if you do start treatment when you 're sick well what happens your viral load comes down
but compared to what what happens if you 're not on treatment
well you die so your viral load goes to zero
and all of this green stuff here including the spikes which are because you couldn 't get to the pharmacy or you ran out of drugs or you went on a three day party binge and forgot to take your drugs or because you 've started to get resistance or whatever all of that is virus that wouldn 't be out there except for treatment
now am i saying oh well great prevention strategy
let 's just stop treating people
of course not of course not
we need to expand antiretroviral treatment as much as we can
but what i am doing is calling into question those people who say that more treatment is all the prevention we need
that 's simply not necessarily true and i think we can learn a lot from the experience of gay men in rich countries where treatment has been widely available for going on 15 years now
and what we 've seen is that actually condom use rates which were very very high the gay community responded very rapidly to hiv with extremely little help from public health nerds i would say that condom use rate has come down dramatically since treatment for two reasons really one is the assumption of oh well if he 's infected he 's probably on meds and his viral load 's going to be low so i 'm pretty safe
and the other thing is that people are simply not as scared of hiv as they were of aids and rightly so
aids was a disfiguring disease that killed you and hiv is an invisible virus that makes you take a pill every day
and that 's boring but is it as boring as having to use a condom every time you have sex no matter how drunk you are no matter how many poppers you 've taken whatever
if we look at the data we can see that the answer to that question is mmm
so these are data from scotland
you see the peak in drug injectors before they started the national needle exchange program
then it came way down
and both in heterosexuals mostly in commercial sex and in drug users you 've really got nothing much going on after treatment begins and that 's because of that alignment of incentives that i talked about earlier
but in gay men you 've got quite a dramatic rise starting three or four years after treatment became widely available
this is of new infections
what does that mean
it means that the combined effect of being less worried and having more virus out there in the population more people living longer healthier lives more likely to be getting laid with hiv is outweighing the effects of lower viral load and that 's a very worrisome thing
what does it mean
it means we need to be doing more prevention the more treatment we have
is that what 's happening
no and i call it the compassion conundrum
we 've talked a lot about compassion the last couple of days and what 's happening really is that people are unable quite to bring themselves to put in good sexual and reproductive health services for sex workers unable quite to be giving out needles to junkies
but once they 've gone from being transgressive people whose behaviors we don 't want to condone to being aids victims we come over all compassionate and buy them incredibly expensive drugs for the rest of their lives
it doesn 't make any sense from a public health point of view
i want to give what 's very nearly the last word to ines
ines is a a transgender hooker on the streets of jakarta she 's a chick with a dick
why does she do that job
well of course because she 's forced into it because she doesn 't have any better option etc etc
and if we could just teach her to sew and get her a nice job in a factory all would be well
this is what factory workers earn in an hour in indonesia on average 20 cents
it varies a bit province to province
i do speak to sex workers 15,000 of them for this particular slide and this is what sex workers say they earn in an hour
so it 's not a great job but for a lot of people it really is quite a rational choice
okay ines
we 've got the tools the knowledge and the cash and commitment to preventing hiv too
ines so why is prevalence still rising
it 's all politics
when you get to politics nothing makes sense
elizabeth pisani when you get to politics nothing makes sense
so from the point of view of a sex worker politicians are making no sense
from the point of view of a public health nerd junkies are doing dumb things
the truth is that everyone has a different rationale
there are as many different ways of being rational as there are human beings on the planet and that 's one of the glories of human existence
but those ways of being rational are not independent of one another so it 's rational for a drug injector to share needles because of a stupid decision that 's made by a politician and it 's rational for a politician to make that stupid decision because they 're responding to what they think the voters want
but here 's the thing we are the voters
we 're not all of them of course but ted is a community of opinion leaders
and everyone who 's in this room and everyone who 's watching this out there on the web i think has a duty to demand of their politicians that we make policy based on scientific evidence and on common sense
it 's going to be really hard for us to individually affect what 's rational for every frankie and every ines out there but you can at least use your vote to stop politicians doing stupid things that spread hiv
thank you
in the last 50 years we 've been building the suburbs with a lot of unintended consequences
and i 'm going to talk about some of those consequences and just present a whole bunch of really interesting projects that i think give us tremendous reasons to be really optimistic that the big design and development project of the next 50 years is going to be retrofitting suburbia
so whether it 's redeveloping dying malls or re-inhabiting dead big-box stores or reconstructing wetlands out of parking lots i think the fact is the growing number of empty and under-performing especially retail sites throughout suburbia gives us actually a tremendous opportunity to take our least-sustainable landscapes right now and convert them into more sustainable places
and in the process what that allows us to do is to redirect a lot more of our growth back into existing communities that could use a boost and have the infrastructure in place instead of continuing to tear down trees and to tear up the green space out at the edges
so why is this important
i think there are any number of reasons and i 'm just going to not get into detail but mention a few
just from the perspective of climate change the average urban dweller in the u.s.
has about one-third the carbon footprint of the average suburban dweller mostly because suburbanites drive a lot more and living in detached buildings you have that much more exterior surface to leak energy out of
so strictly from a climate change perspective the cities are already relatively green
the big opportunity to reduce greenhouse gas emissions is actually in urbanizing the suburbs
all that driving that we 've been doing out in the suburbs we have doubled the amount of miles we drive
it 's increased our dependence on foreign oil despite the gains in fuel efficiency
we 're just driving so much more we haven 't been able to keep up technologically
public health is another reason to consider retrofitting
researchers at the cdc and other places have increasingly been linking suburban development patterns with sedentary lifestyles
and those have been linked then with the rather alarming growing rates of obesity shown in these maps here and that obesity has also been triggering great increases in heart disease and diabetes to the point where a child born today has a one-in-three chance of developing diabetes
and that rate has been escalating at the same rate as children not walking to school anymore again because of our development patterns
and then there 's finally there 's the affordability question
i mean how affordable is it to continue to live in suburbia with rising gas prices
suburban expansion to cheap land for the last 50 years you know the cheap land out on the edge has helped generations of families enjoy the american dream
but increasingly the savings promised by drive-till-you-qualify affordability which is basically our model those savings are wiped out when you consider the transportation costs
for instance here in atlanta about half of households make between $ 20,000 and $ 50,000 a year and they are spending 29 percent of their income on housing and 32 percent on transportation
i mean that 's 2005 figures
that 's before we got up to the four bucks a gallon
you know none of us really tend to do the math on our transportation costs and they 're not going down any time soon
whether you love suburbia 's leafy privacy or you hate its soulless commercial strips there are reasons why it 's important to retrofit
but is it practical
i think it is
june williamson and i have been researching this topic for over a decade and we 've found over 80 varied projects
but that they 're really all market driven and what 's driving the market in particular number one is major demographic shifts
we all tend to think of suburbia as this very family-focused place but that 's really not the case anymore
since 2000 already two-thirds of households in suburbia did not have kids in them
we just haven 't caught up with the actual realities of this
the reasons for this have a lot to with the dominance of the two big demographic groups right now the baby boomers retiring and then there 's a gap generation x which is a small generation
they 're still having kids but generation y hasn 't even started hitting child-rearing age
they 're the other big generation
so as a result of that demographers predict that through 2025 75 to 85 percent of new households will not have kids in them
and the market research consumer research asking the boomers and gen y what it is they would like what they would like to live in tells us there is going to be a huge demand and we 're already seeing it for more urban lifestyles within suburbia
that basically the boomers want to be able to age in place and gen y would like to live an urban lifestyle but most of their jobs will continue to be out in suburbia
the other big dynamic of change is the sheer performance of underperforming asphalt
now i keep thinking this would be a great name for an indie rock band but developers generally use it to refer to underused parking lots and suburbia is full of them
when the postwar suburbs were first built out on the cheap land away from downtown it made sense to just build surface parking lots
but those sites have now been leapfrogged and leapfrogged again as we 've just continued to sprawl and they now have a relatively central location
it no longer just makes sense
that land is more valuable than just surface parking lots
it now makes sense to go back in build a deck and build up on those sites
so what do you do with a dead mall dead office park
it turns out all sorts of things
in a slow economy like ours re-inhabitation is one of the more popular strategies
so this happens to be a dead mall in st. louis that 's been re-inhabited as art-space
it 's now home to artist studios theater groups dance troupes
it 's not pulling in as much tax revenue as it once was but it 's serving its community
it 's keeping the lights on
it 's becoming i think a really great institution
other malls have been re-inhabited as nursing homes as universities and as all variety of office space
we also found a lot of examples of dead big-box stores that have been converted into all sorts of community-serving uses as well lots of schools lots of churches and lots of libraries like this one
this was a little grocery store a food lion grocery store that is now a public library
in addition to i think doing a beautiful adaptive reuse they tore up some of the parking spaces put in bioswales to collect and clean the runoff put in a lot more sidewalks to connect to the neighborhoods
and they 've made this what was just a store along a commercial strip into a community gathering space
this one is a little l-shaped strip shopping center in phoenix arizona
really all they did was they gave it a fresh coat of bright paint a gourmet grocery and they put up a restaurant in the old post office
never underestimate the power of food to turn a place around and make it a destination
it 's been so successful they 've now taken over the strip across the street
the real estate ads in the neighborhood all very proudly proclaim walking distance to le grande orange because it provided its neighborhood with what sociologists like to call a third place
if home is the first place and work is the second place the third place is where you go to hang out and build community
and especially as suburbia is becoming less centered on the family the family households there 's a real hunger for more third places
so the most dramatic retrofits are really those in the next category the next strategy redevelopment
now during the boom there were several really dramatic redevelopment projects where the original building was scraped to the ground and then the whole site was rebuilt at significantly greater density a sort of compact walkable urban neighborhoods
but some of them have been much more incremental
this is mashpee commons the oldest retrofit that we 've found
and it 's just incrementally over the last 20 years built urbanism on top of its parking lots
so the black and white photo shows the simple 60 's strip shopping center
and then the maps above that show its gradual transformation into a compact mixed-use new england village and it has plans now that have been approved for it to connect to new residential neighborhoods across the arterials and over to the other side
so you know sometimes it 's incremental
sometimes it 's all at once
this is another infill project on the parking lots this one of an office park outside of washington d.c.
when metrorail expanded transit into the suburbs and opened a station nearby to this site the owners decided to build a new parking deck and then insert on top of their surface lots a new main street several apartments and condo buildings while keeping the existing office buildings
here is the site in 1940 it was just a little farm in the village of hyattsville
by 1980 it had been subdivided into a big mall on one side and the office park on the other and then some buffer sites for a library and a church to the far right
today the transit the main street and the new housing have all been built
eventually i expect that the streets will probably extend through a redevelopment of the mall
plans have already been announced for a lot of those garden apartments above the mall to be redeveloped
transit is a big driver of retrofits
so here 's what it looks like
you can sort of see the funky new condo buildings in between the office buildings and the public space and the new main street
this one is one of my favorites belmar
i think they really built an attractive place here and have just employed all-green construction
there 's massive p.v. arrays on the roofs as well as wind turbines
this was a very large mall on a hundred-acre superblock
it 's now 22 walkable urban blocks with public streets two public parks eight bus lines and a range of housing types and so it 's really given lakewood colorado the downtown that this particular suburb never had
here was the mall in its heyday
they had their prom in the mall they loved their mall
so here 's the site in 1975 with the mall
by 1995 the mall has died
the department store has been kept and we found this was true in many cases
the department stores are multistory they 're better built
they 're easy to be re-adapted
but the one story stuff ...
that 's really history
so here it is at projected build-out
this project i think has great connectivity to the existing neighborhoods
it 's providing 1,500 households with the option of a more urban lifestyle
it 's about two-thirds built out right now
here 's what the new main street looks like
it 's very successful and it 's helped to prompt eight of the 13 regional malls in denver have now or have announced plans to be retrofitted
but it 's important to note that all of this retrofitting is not occurring just bulldozers are coming and just plowing down the whole city
no it 's pockets of walkability on the sites of under-performing properties
and so it 's giving people more choices but it 's not taking away choices
but it 's also not really enough to just create pockets of walkability
you want to also try to get more systemic transformation
we need to also retrofit the corridors themselves
so this is one that has been retrofitted in california
they took the commercial strip shown on the black-and-white images below and they built a boulevard that has become the main street for their town
and it 's transformed from being an ugly unsafe undesirable address to becoming a beautiful attractive dignified sort of good address
i mean now we 're hoping we start to see it they 've already built city hall attracted two hotels
i could imagine beautiful housing going up along there without tearing down another tree
so there 's a lot of great things but i 'd love to see more corridors getting retrofitting
but densification is not going to work everywhere
sometimes re-greening is really the better answer
there 's a lot to learn from successful landbanking programs in cities like flint michigan
there 's also a burgeoning suburban farming movement sort of victory gardens meets the internet
but perhaps one of the most important re-greening aspects is the opportunity to restore the local ecology as in this example outside of minneapolis
when the shopping center died the city restored the site 's original wetlands creating lakefront property which then attracted private investment the first private investment to this very low-income neighborhood in over 40 years
so they 've managed to both restore the local ecology and the local economy at the same time
this is another re-greening example
it also makes sense in very strong markets
this one in seattle is on the site of a mall parking lot adjacent to a new transit stop
and the wavy line is a path alongside a creek that has now been daylit
the creek had been culverted under the parking lot
but daylighting our creeks really improves their water quality and contributions to habitat
so i 've shown you some of the first generation of retrofits
what 's next
i think we have three challenges for the future
the first is to plan retrofitting much more systemically at the metropolitan scale
we need to be able to target which areas really should be re-greened
where should we be redeveloping
and where should we be encouraging re-inhabitation
these slides just show two images from a larger project that looked at trying to do that for atlanta
i led a team that was asked to imagine atlanta 100 years from now
and we chose to try to reverse sprawl through three simple moves expensive but simple
one in a hundred years transit on all major rail and road corridors
two in a hundred years thousand foot buffers on all stream corridors
it 's a little extreme but we 've got a little water problem
in a hundred years subdivisions that simply end up too close to water or too far from transit won 't be viable
and so we 've created the eco-acre transfer-to-transfer development rights to the transit corridors and allow the re-greening of those former subdivisions for food and energy production
so the second challenge is to improve the architectural design quality of the retrofits
and i close with this image of democracy in action this is a protest that 's happening on a retrofit in silver spring maryland on an astroturf town green
now retrofits are often accused of being examples of faux downtowns and instant urbanism and not without reason you don 't get much more phony than an astroturf town green
i have to say these are very hybrid places
they are new but trying to look old
they have urban streetscapes but suburban parking ratios
their populations are more diverse than typical suburbia but they 're less diverse than cities
and they are public places but that are managed by private companies
and just the surface appearance are often like the astroturf here they make me wince
so you know i mean i 'm glad that the urbanism is doing its job
the fact that a protest is happening really does mean that the layout of the blocks the streets and blocks the putting in of public space compromised as it may be is still a really great thing
but we 've got to get the architecture better
the final challenge is for all of you
i want you to join the protest and start demanding more sustainable suburban places more sustainable places period
but culturally we tend to think that downtowns should be dynamic and we expect that
but we seem to have an expectation that the suburbs should forever remain frozen in whatever adolescent form they were first given birth to
it 's time to let them grow up so i want you to all support the zoning changes the road diets the infrastructure improvements and the retrofits that are coming soon to a neighborhood near you
thank you
i want you to take a trip with me
picture yourself driving down a small road in africa and as you drive along you look off to the side and this is what you see you see a field of graves
and you stop and you get out of your car and you take a picture
and you go into the town and you inquire what 's going on here
and people are initially reluctant to tell you
and then someone says these are the recent aids deaths in our community
hiv isn 't like other medical conditions it 's stigmatizing
people are reluctant to talk about it there 's a fear associated with it
and i 'm going to talk about hiv today about the deaths about the stigma
it 's a medical story but more than that it 's a social story
this map depicts the global distribution of hiv
and as you can see africa has a disproportionate share of the infection
there are 33 million people living with hiv in the world today
of these two-thirds 22 million are living in sub-saharan africa
there are 1.4 million pregnant women in low- and middle-income countries living with hiv and of these 90 percent are in sub-saharan africa
we talk about things in relative terms
and i 'm going to talk about annual pregnancies and hiv-positive mothers
the united states a large country each year 7,000 mothers with hiv who give birth to a child
but you go to rwanda a very small country 8,000 mothers with hiv who are pregnant
and then you go to baragwanath hospital outside of johannesburg in south africa and 8,000 hiv-positive pregnant women giving birth a hospital the same as a country
and to realize that this is just the tip of an iceberg that when you compare everything here to south africa it just pales because in south africa each year 300,000 mothers with hiv give birth to children
so we talk about pmtct and we refer to pmtct prevention of mother to child transmission
i think there 's an assumption amongst most people in the public that if a mother is hiv-positive she 's going to infect her child
the reality is really very different
in resource-rich countries with all the tests and treatment we currently have less than two percent of babies are born hiv-positive 98 percent of babies are born hiv-negative
and yet the reality in resource-poor countries in the absence of tests and treatment 40 percent 40 percent of children are infected 40 percent versus two percent an enormous difference
so these programs and i 'm going to refer to pmtct though my talk these prevention programs simply they 're the tests and the drugs that we give to mothers to prevent them from infecting their babies and also the medicines we give to mothers to keep them healthy and alive to raise their children
so it 's the test a mother gets when she comes in
it 's the drugs she receives to protect the baby that 's inside the uterus and during delivery
it 's the guidance she gets around infant feeding and safer sex
it 's an entire package of services and it works
so in the united states since the advent of treatment in the middle of the 1990s there 's been an 80-percent decline in the number of hiv-infected children
less than 100 babies are born with hiv each year in the united states and yet still over 400,000 children are born every year in the world today with hiv
what does that mean
it means 1,100 children infected each day 1,100 children each day infected with hiv
and where do they come from
well less than one comes from the united states
one on average comes from europe
100 come from asia and the pacific
and each day a thousand babies a thousand babies are born each day with hiv in africa
so again i look at the globe here and the disproportionate share of hiv in africa
and let 's look at another map
and here again we see africa has a disproportionate share of the numbers of doctors
that thin sliver you see here that 's africa
and it 's the same with nurses
the truth is sub-saharan africa has 24 percent of the global disease burden and yet only three percent of the world 's health care workers
that means doctors and nurses simply don 't have the time to take care of patients
a nurse in a busy clinic will see 50 to 100 patients in a day which leaves her just minutes per patient minutes per patient
and so when we look at these pmtct programs what does it mean
well back in 2001 when there was just a simple test and a single dose of a drug a nurse in the course of her few minutes with a patient would have to counsel for the hiv test perform the hiv test explain the results dispense a single dose of the drug nevirapine explain how to take it discuss infant feeding options reinforce infant feeding and test the baby in minutes
well fortunately since 2001 we 've got new treatments new tests and we 're far more successful but we don 't have any more nurses
and so these are the tests a nurse now has to do in those same few minutes
it 's not possible it doesn 't work
and so we need to find better ways of providing care
this is a picture of a maternal health clinic in africa mothers coming pregnant and with their babies
these women are here for care but we know that just doing a test just giving someone a drug it 's not enough
meds don 't equal medical care
doctors and nurses frankly don 't have the time or skills to tell people what to do in ways they understand
i 'm a doctor i tell people things to do and i expect them to follow my guidance because i 'm a doctor i went to harvard but the reality is if i tell a patient you should have safer sex
you should always use a condom and yet in her relationship she 's not empowered what 's going to happen
if i tell her to take her medicines every day and yet no one in the household knows about her illness so it 's just not going to work
and so we need to do more we need to do it differently we need to do it in ways that are affordable and accessible and can be taken to scale which means it can be done everywhere
so i want to tell you a story i want to take you on a little trip
imagine yourself if you can you 're a young woman in africa you 're going to the hospital or clinic
you go in for a test and you find out that you 're pregnant and you 're delighted
and then they give you another test and they tell you you 're hiv-positive and you 're devastated
and the nurse takes you into a room and she tells you about the tests and hiv and the medicines you can take and how to take care of yourself and your baby and you hear none of it
all you 're hearing is i 'm going to die and my baby is going to die
and then you 're out on the street and you don 't know where to go
and you don 't know who you can talk to because the truth is hiv is so stigmatizing that if you partner your family anyone in your home you 're likely to be thrown out without any means of support
and this this is the face and story of hiv in africa today
but we 're here to talk about possible solutions and some good news
and i want to change the story a little bit
take the same mother and the nurse after she gives her her test takes her to a room
the door opens and there 's a room full of mothers mothers with babies and they 're sitting and they 're talking they 're listening
they 're drinking tea they 're having sandwiches
and she goes inside and woman comes up to her and says welcome to mothers2mothers
have a seat you 're safe here
we 're all hiv-positive
you 're going to be okay you 're going to live
your baby is going to be hiv-negative
we view mothers as a community 's single greatest resource
mothers take care of the children take care of the home
so often the men are gone
they 're working or they 're not part of the household
our organization mothers2mothers enlists women with hiv as care providers
we bring mothers who have hiv who 've been through these pmtct programs in the very facilities to come back and work side by side with doctors and nurses as part of the health care team
these mothers we call them mentor mothers are able to engage women who just like themselves pregnant with babies have found out about being hiv-positive who need support and education
and they support them around the diagnosis and educate them about how to take their medicines how to take care of themselves how to take care of their babies
consider if you needed surgery you would want the best possible technical surgeon right
but if you wanted to understand what that surgery would do to your life you 'd like to engage someone someone who 's had the procedure
patients are experts on their own experience and they can share that experience with others
this is the medical care that goes beyond just medicines
so the mothers who work for us they come from the communities in which they work
they 're hired they 're paid as professional members of the health care teams just like doctors and nurses
and we open bank accounts for them and they 're paid directly into the accounts because their money 's protected the men can 't take it away from them
they go through two to three weeks of rigorous curriculum-based education training
now doctors and nurses they too get trained
but so often they only get trained once so they 're not aware of new medicines new guidelines as they come out
our mentor mothers get trained every single year and retrained
and so doctors and nurses they look up to them as experts
imagine that a woman a former patient being able to educate her doctor for the first time and educate the other patients that she 's taking care of
our organization has three goals
the first to prevent mother-to-child transmission
the second keep mothers healthy keep mothers alive keep the children alive no more orphans
and the third and maybe the most grand is to find ways to empower women enable them to fight the stigma and to live positive and productive lives with hiv
so how do we do it
well maybe the most important engagement is the one-to-one seeing patients one-to-one educating them supporting them explaining how they can take care of themselves
we go beyond that we try to bring in the husbands the partners
in africa it 's very very hard to engage men
men are not frequently part of pregnancy care
but in rwanda in one country they 've got a policy that a woman can 't come for care unless she brings the father of the baby with her that 's the rule
and so the father and the mother together go through the counseling and the testing
the father and the mother together they get the results
and this is so important in breaking through the stigma
disclosure is so central to prevention
how do you have safer sex how do you use a condom regularly if there hasn 't been disclosure
disclosure is so important to treatment because again people need the support of family members and friends to take their medicines regularly
we also work in groups
now the groups it 's not like me lecturing but what happens is women they come together under the support and guidance of our mentor mothers they come together and they share their personal experiences
and it 's through the sharing that people get tactics of how to take care of themselves how to disclose how to take medicines
and then there 's the community outreach engaging women in their communities
if we can change the way households believe and think we can change the way communities believe and think
and if we can change enough communities we can change national attitudes
we can change national attitudes to women and national attitudes to hiv
the hardest barrier really is around stigma reduction
we have the medicines we have the tests but how do you reduce the stigma
and it 's important about disclosure
so a couple years ago one of the mentor mothers came back and she told me a story
she had been asked by one of the clients to go to the home of the client because the client wanted to tell the mother and her brothers and sisters about her hiv status and she was afraid to go by herself
and so the mentor mother went along with
and the patient walked into the house and said to her mother and siblings i have something to tell you i 'm hiv-positive
and everybody was quiet
and then her oldest brother stood up and said i too have something to tell you
i 'm hiv-positive
i 've been afraid to tell everybody
and then this older sister stood up and said i too am living with the virus and i 've been ashamed
and then her younger brother stood up and said i 'm also positive
i thought you were going to throw me out of the family
and you see where this is going
the last sister stood up and said i 'm also positive
i thought you were going to hate me
and there they were all of them together for the first time being able to share this experience for the first time and to support each other for the first time
female women come to us and they are crying and scared
i tell them my story that i am hiv-positive but my child is hiv-negative
i tell them you are going to make it and you will raise a healthy baby
i am proof that there is hope
mitchell besser remember the images i showed you of how few doctors and nurses there are in africa
and it is a crisis in health care systems
even as we have more tests and more drugs we can 't reach people we don 't have enough providers
so we talk in terms of what we call task-shifting
task-shifting is traditionally when you take health care services from one provider and have another provider do it
typically it 's a doctor giving a job to a nurse
and the issue in africa is that there are fewer nurses really than doctors and so we need to find new paradigm for health care
how do you build a better health care system
we 've chosen to redefine the health care system as a doctor a nurse and a mentor mother
and so what nurses do is that they ask the mentor mothers to explain how to take the drugs the side effects
they delegate education about infant feeding family planning safer sex actions that nurses simple just don 't have time for
so we go back to the prevention of mother to child transmission
the world is increasingly seeing these programs as the bridge to comprehensive maternal and child health
and our organization helps women across that bridge
the care doesn 't stop when the baby 's born we deal with the ongoing health of the mother and baby ensuring that they live healthy successful lives
our organization works on three levels
the first at the patient level mothers and babies keeping babies from getting hiv keeping mothers healthy to raise them
the second communities empowering women
they become leaders within their communities
they change the way communities think we need to change attitudes to hiv
we need to change attitudes to women in africa
we have to do that
and then rework the level of the health care systems building stronger health care systems
our health care systems are broken
they 're not going to work the way they 're currently designed
and so doctors and nurses who need to try to change people 's behaviors don 't have the skills don 't have the time our mentor mothers do
and so in redefining the health care teams by bringing the mentor mothers in we can do that
i started the program in capetown south africa back in 2001
it was at that point just the spark of an idea
referencing steven johnson 's very lovely speech yesterday on where ideas come from i was in the shower at the time i was alone
the program is now working in nine countries we have 670 program sites we 're seeing about 230,000 women every month we 're employing 1,600 mentor mothers and last year they enrolled 300,000 hiv-positive pregnant women and mothers
that is 20 percent of the global hiv-positive pregnant women 20 percent of the world
what 's extraordinary is how simple the premise is
mothers with hiv caring for mothers with hiv
past patients taking care of present patients
and empowerment through employment reducing stigma
female there is hope hope that one day we shall win this fight against hiv and aids
each person must know their hiv status
those who are hiv-negative must know how to stay negative
those who are hiv-infected must know how to take care of themselves
hiv-positive pregnant women must get pmtct services in order to have hiv-negative babies
all of this is possible if we each contribute to this fight
mb simple solutions to complex problems
mothers caring for mothers
it 's transformational
thank you
the job of uncovering the global food waste scandal started for me when i was 15 years old
i bought some pigs i was living in sussex
and i started to feed them in the most traditional and environmentally friendly way
i went to my school kitchen and i said give me the scraps that my school friends have turned their noses up at
i went to the local baker and took their stale bread
i went to the local greengrocer and i went to a farmer who was throwing away potatoes because they were the wrong shape or size for supermarkets
this was great my pigs turned that food waste into delicious pork i sold that pork to my school friends parents and i made a good pocket money addition to my teenage allowance
but i noticed that most of the food that i was giving my pigs was in fact fit for human consumption and that i was only scratching the surface and that right the way up the food supply chain in supermarkets greengrocers bakers in our homes in factories and farms we were hemorrhaging out food
supermarkets didn 't even want to talk to me about how much food they were wasting
i 'd been round the back i 'd seen bins full of food being locked and then trucked off to landfill sites and i thought surely there is something more sensible to do with food than waste it
one morning when i was feeding my pigs i noticed a particularly tasty-looking sun-dried tomato loaf that used to crop up from time to time
i grabbed hold of it sat down and ate my breakfast with my pigs
that was the first act of what i later learned to call freeganism really an exhibition of the injustice of food waste and the provision of the solution to food waste which is simply to sit down and eat food rather than throwing it away
that became as it were a way of confronting large businesses in the business of wasting food and exposing most importantly to the public that when we 're talking about food being thrown away we 're not talking about rotten stuff we 're not talking about stuff that 's beyond the pale
we 're talking about good fresh food that is being wasted on a colossal scale
eventually i set about writing my book really to demonstrate the extent of this problem on a global scale what this shows is a nation-by-nation breakdown of the likely level of food waste in each country in the world
unfortunately empirical data good hard stats don 't exist and therefore to prove my point i first of all had to find some proxy way of uncovering how much food was being wasted
so i took the food supply of every single country and i compared it to what was actually likely to be being consumed in each country
that 's based on diet intake surveys it 's based on levels of obesity it 's based on a range of factors that gives you an approximate guess as to how much food is actually going into people 's mouths
that black line in the middle of that table is the likely level of consumption with an allowance for certain levels of inevitable waste
there will always be waste i 'm not that unrealistic that i think we can live in a waste-free world
but that black line shows what a food supply should be in a country if they allow for a good stable secure nutritional diet for every person in that country
any dot above that line and you 'll quickly notice that that includes most countries in the world represents unnecessary surplus and is likely to reflect levels of waste in each country
as a country gets richer it invests more and more in getting more and more surplus into its shops and restaurants and as you can see most european and north american countries fall between 150 and 200 percent of the nutritional requirements of their populations
so a country like america has twice as much food on its shop shelves and in its restaurants than is actually required to feed the american people
but the thing that really struck me when i plotted all this data and it was a lot of numbers was that you can see how it levels off
countries rapidly shoot towards that 150 mark and then they level off and they don 't really go on rising as you might expect
so i decided to unpack that data a little bit further to see if that was true or false
and that 's what i came up with
if you include not just the food that ends up in shops and restaurants but also the food that people feed to livestock the maize the soy the wheat that humans could eat but choose to fatten livestock instead to produce increasing amounts of meat and dairy products what you find is that most rich countries have between three and four times the amount of food that their population needs to feed itself
a country like america has four times the amount of food that it needs
when people talk about the need to increase global food production to feed those nine billion people that are expected on the planet by 2050 i always think of these graphs
the fact is we have an enormous buffer in rich countries between ourselves and hunger
we 've never had such gargantuan surpluses before
in many ways this is a great success story of human civilization of the agricultural surpluses that we set out to achieve 12,000 years ago
it is a success story it has been a success story
but what we have to recognize now is that we are reaching the ecological limits that our planet can bear and when we chop down forests as we are every day to grow more and more food when we extract water from depleting water reserves when we emit fossil fuel emissions in the quest to grow more and more food and then we throw away so much of it we have to think about what we can start saving
and yesterday i went to one of the local supermarkets that i often visit to inspect if you like what they 're throwing away
i found quite a few packets of biscuits amongst all the fruit and vegetables and everything else that was in there
and i thought well this could serve as a symbol for today
so i want you to imagine that these nine biscuits that i found in the bin represent the global food supply okay we start out with nine
that 's what 's in fields around the world every single year
the first biscuit we 're going to lose before we even leave the farm
that 's a problem primarily associated with developing work agriculture whether it 's a lack of infrastructure refrigeration pasteurization grain stores even basic fruit crates which means that food goes to waste before it even leaves the fields
the next three biscuits are the foods that we decide to feed to livestock the maize the wheat and the soya
unfortunately our beasts are inefficient animals and they turn two-thirds of that into feces and heat so we 've lost those two and we 've only kept this one in meat and dairy products
two more we 're going to throw away directly into bins
this is what most of us think of when we think of food waste what ends up in the garbage what ends up in supermarket bins what ends up in restaurant bins we 've lost another two and we 've left ourselves with just four biscuits to feed on
that is not a superlatively efficient use of global resources especially when you think of the billion hungry people that exist already in the world
having gone through the data i then needed to demonstrate where that food ends up
where does it end up we 're used to seeing the stuff on our plates but what about all the stuff that goes missing in between
supermarkets are an easy place to start
this is the result of my hobby which is unofficial bin inspections
strange you might think but if we could rely on corporations to tell us what they were doing in the back of their stores we wouldn 't need to go sneaking around the back opening up bins and having a look at what 's inside
but this is what you can see more or less on every street corner in britain in europe in north america
it represents a colossal waste of food but what i discovered whilst i was writing my book was that this very evident abundance of waste was actually the tip of the iceberg
when you start going up the supply chain you find where the real food waste is happening on a gargantuan scale
can i have a show of hands if you have a loaf of sliced bread in your house
who lives in a household where that crust that slice at the first and last end of each loaf who lives in a household where it does get eaten
okay most people not everyone but most people and this is i 'm glad to say what i see across the world and yet has anyone seen a supermarket or sandwich shop anywhere in the world that serves sandwiches with crusts on it
i certainly haven 't
so i kept on thinking where do those crusts go
this is the answer unfortunately 13,000 slices of fresh bread coming out of this one single factory every single day day-fresh bread
in the same year that i visited this factory i went to pakistan where people in 2008 were going hungry as a result of a squeeze on global food supplies
we contribute to that squeeze by depositing food in bins here in britain and elsewhere in the world we take food off the market shelves that hungry people depend on
go one step up and you get to farmers who throw away sometimes a third or even more of their harvest because of cosmetic standards
this farmer for example has invested 16,000 pounds in growing spinach not one leaf of which he harvested because there was a little bit of grass growing in amongst it
potatoes that are cosmetically imperfect all going for pigs
parsnips that are too small for supermarket specifications tomatoes in tenerife oranges in florida bananas in ecuador where i visited last year all being discarded this is one day 's waste from one banana plantation in ecuador
all being discarded perfectly edible because they 're the wrong shape or size
if we do that to fruit and vegetables you bet we can do it to animals too
liver lungs heads tails kidneys testicles all of these things which are traditional delicious and nutritious parts of our gastronomy go to waste offal consumption has halved in britain and america in the last 30 years
as a result this stuff gets fed to dogs at best or is incinerated
this man in kashgar xinjiang province in western china is serving up his national dish
it 's called sheep 's organs
it 's delicious it 's nutritious and as i learned when i went to kashgar it symbolizes their taboo against food waste
i was sitting in a roadside cafe
a chef came to talk to me i finished my bowl and halfway through the conversation he stopped talking and he started frowning into my bowl
i thought my goodness what taboo have i broken
how have i insulted my host
he pointed at three grains of rice at the bottom of my bowl and he said clean
i thought my god you know i go around the world telling people to stop wasting food
this guy has thrashed me at my own game
but it gave me faith it gave me faith that we the people do have the power to stop this tragic waste of resources if we regard it as socially unacceptable to waste food on a colossal scale if we make noise about it tell corporations about it tell governments we want to see an end to food waste we do have the power to bring about that change
fish 40 to 60 percent of european fish are discarded at sea they don 't even get landed
in our homes we 've lost touch with food
this is an experiment i did on three lettuces
who keeps lettuces in their fridge
most people the one on the left was kept in a fridge for 10 days
the one in the middle on my kitchen table not much difference
the one on the right i treated like cut flowers
it 's a living organism cut the slice off stuck it in a vase of water it was all right for another two weeks after this
some food waste as i said at the beginning will inevitably arise so the question is what is the best thing to do with it
i answered that question when i was 15
in fact humans answered that question 6,000 years ago we domesticated pigs to turn food waste back into food
and yet in europe that practice has become illegal since 2001 as a result of the foot-and-mouth outbreak
it 's unscientific it 's unnecessary
if you cook food for pigs just as if you cook food for humans it is rendered safe
it 's also a massive saving of resources
at the moment europe depends on importing millions of tons of soy from south america where its production contributes to global warming to deforestation to biodiversity loss to feed livestock here in europe
at the same time we throw away millions of tons of food waste which we could and should be feeding them
if we did that and fed it to pigs we would save that amount of carbon
if we feed our food waste which is the current government favorite way of getting rid of food waste to anaerobic digestion which turns food waste into gas to produce electricity you save a paltry 448 kilograms of carbon dioxide per ton of food waste it 's much better to feed it to pigs
we knew that during the war
a silver lining it has kicked off globally the quest to tackle food waste
feeding the 5,000 is an event i first organized in 2009
we fed 5,000 people all on food that otherwise would have been wasted
since then it 's happened again in london it 's happening internationally and across the country
it 's a way of organizations coming together to celebrate food to say the best thing to do with food is to eat and enjoy it and to stop wasting it
for the sake of the planet we live on for the sake of our children for the sake of all the other organisms that share our planet with us we are a terrestrial animal and we depend on our land for food at the moment we are trashing our land to grow food that no one eats
stop wasting food thank you very much

compassion what does it look like
come with me to 915 south bloodworth street in raleigh north carolina where i grew up
if you come in you will see us evening time at table set for ten but not always all seats filled at the point when dinner is ready to be served
since mom had eight kids sometimes she said she couldn 't tell who was who and where they were
before we could eat she would ask are all the children in
and if someone happened to be missing we would have to we say fix a plate for that person put it in the oven then we could say grace and we could eat
also while we were at the table there was a ritual in our family when something significant had happened for any one of us whether mom had just been elected as the president of the pta or whether dad had gotten an assignment at the college of our denomination or whether someone had won the jabberwocky contest for talent the ritual at the family was once the announcement is made we must take five ten minutes to do what we call make over that person that is to make a fuss over the one who had been honored in some way
for when one is honored all are honored
also we had to make a report on our extended visited members that is extended members of the family sick and elderly shut in
my task was at least once a week to visit mother lassiter who lived on east street mother williamson who lived on bledsoe avenue and mother lathers who lived on oberlin road
why because they were old and infirm and we needed to go by to see if they needed anything
for mom said to be family is to care and share and to look out for one another
they are our family
and of course sometimes there was a bonus for going
they would offer sweets or money
mom says if they ask you what it costs to either go shopping for them you must always say nothing and if they insist say whatever you mind to give me this was the nature of being at that table
in fact she indicated that if we would do that not only would we have the joy of receiving the gratitude from the members of the extended family but she said even god will smile and when god smiles there is peace and justice and joy
so at the table at 915 i learned something about compassion
of course it was a minister 's family so we had to add god into it
and so i came to think that mama eternal mama eternal is always wondering are all the children in
and if we had been faithful in caring and sharing we had the sense that justice and peace would have a chance in the world
now it was not always wonderful at that table
let me explain a point at which we did not rise to the occasion
it was christmas and at our family oh what a morning
christmas morning where we open up our gifts where we have special prayers and where we get to the old upright piano and we would sing carols it was a very intimate moment
in fact you could come down to the tree to get your gifts and get ready to sing and then get ready for breakfast without even taking a bath or getting dressed except that daddy messed it up
there was a member of his staff who did not have any place on that particular christmas to celebrate
and daddy brought elder revels to the christmas family celebration
we thought he must be out of his mind
this is our time this is intimate time
this is when we can just be who we are and now we have this stuffy brother with his shirt and tie on while we are still in our pjs
why would daddy bring elder revels
any other time but not to the christmas celebration
and mom overheard us and said well you know what if you really understand the nature of this celebration it is that this is a time where you extend the circle of love
that 's what the celebration is all about
it 's time to make space to share the enjoyment of life in a beloved community
so we sucked up
but growing up at 915 compassion was not a word to be debated it was a sensibility to how we are together
we are sisters and brothers united together
and like chief seattle said we did not spin the web of life
we 're all strands in it
and whatever we do to the web we do to ourselves
now that 's compassion
so let me tell you i kind of look at the world this way
i see pictures and something says now that 's compassion
a harvested field of grain with some grain in the corners reminding me of the hebrew tradition that you may indeed harvest but you must always leave some on the edges just in case there 's someone who has not had the share necessary for good nurture
talk about a picture of compassion
i see always it stirs my heart a picture of dr. martin luther king jr
walking arm in arm with andy young and rabbi heschel and maybe thich nhat hanh and some of the other saints assembled walking across the bridge and going into selma
just a photograph
arm in arm for struggle
suffering together in a common hope that we can be brothers and sisters without the accidents of our birth or our ethnicity robbing us of a sense of unity of being
so there 's another picture here this one i really do like this picture
when dr. martin luther king jr. was assassinated that day everybody in my community was upset
you heard about riots all across the land
bobby kennedy was scheduled to bring an inner city message in indianapolis
this is the picture they said it 's going to be too volatile for you to go
he insisted i must go
so sitting on a flatbed truck the elders of the community are there and bobby stands up and says to the people i have bad news for you
some of you may not have heard that dr. king has been assassinated
i know that you are angry and i know that you would almost wish to have the opportunity to enter now into activities of revenge but he said what i really want you to know is that i know how you feel
because i had someone dear to me snatched away
i know how you feel
and he said i hope that you will have the strength to do what i did
i allowed my anger my bitterness my grief to simmer a while and then i made up my mind that i was going to make a different world and we can do that together
that 's a picture compassion i think i see it
i saw it when the dalai lama came to the riverside church while i was a pastor and he invited representatives of faith traditions from all around the world
he asked them to give a message and they each read in their own language a central affirmation and that was some version of the golden rule as you would that others would do unto you do also unto them
twelve in their ecclesiastical or cultural or tribal attire affirming one message
we are so connected that we must treat each other as if an action toward you is an action toward myself
one more picture while i 'm stinking and thinking about the riverside church 9 11 last night at chagrin fall a newspaperman and a television guy said that evening when a service was held at the riverside church we carried it on our station in this city
it was he said one of the most powerful moments of life together
we were all suffering
but you invited representatives of all of the traditions to come and you invited them
find out what it is in your tradition that tells us what to do when we have been humiliated when we have been despised and rejected and they all spoke out of their own traditions a word about the healing power of solidarity one with the other
i developed a sense of compassion sort of as second nature but i became a preacher
now as a preacher i got a job i got to preach the stuff but i got to do it too
or as father divine in harlem used to say to folks some people preach the gospel
i have to tangibilitate the gospel
so the real issue is how do you tangibilitate compassion
how do you make it real
my faith has constantly lifted up the ideal and challenged me when i fell beneath it
in my tradition there is a gift that we have made to other traditions to everybody around the world who knows the story of the good samaritan
many people think of it primarily in terms of charity random acts of kindness
but for those who really study that text a little more thoroughly you will discover that a question has been raised that leads to this parable
the question was what is the greatest commandment
and according to jesus the word comes forth you must love yourself you must love the lord your god with all your heart mind and soul and your neighbor as yourself
and then the person asked well what do you mean neighbor and he answered it by telling the story of the man who fell among thieves and how religious authorities went the other way and how their supporters in the congregation went the other way but an unsuspecting despised person came along saw the man in need provided oil and wine for his wounds put him on his own transportation and took him to the inn and asked the innkeeper take care of him
and he said here this is the initial investment but if needs continue make sure that you provide them
and whatever else is needed i will provide it and pay for it when i return
this always seemed to me to be a deepening of the sense of what it means to be a good samaritan
a good samaritan is not simply one whose heart is touched in an immediate act of care and charity but one who provides a system of sustained care i like that a system of sustained care in the inn take care
i think maybe it 's one time when the bible talks about a healthcare system and a commitment to do whatever is necessary that all god 's children would have their needs cared for so that we could answer when mommy eternal asks in regards to health are all the children in and we could say yes
oh what a joy it has been to be a person seeking to tangibilitate compassion
i recall that my work as a pastor has always involved caring for their spiritual needs being concerned for housing for healthcare for the prisoners for the infirm for children even the foster care children for whom no one can even keep a record where they started off where they are going
to be a pastor is to care for these individual needs
but now to be a good samaritan and i always say and to be a good american for me is not simply to congratulate myself for the individual acts of care
compassion takes on a corporate dynamic
i believe that whatever we did around that table at bloodworth street must be done around tables and rituals of faith until we become that family that family together that understands the nature of our unity
we are one people together
so let me explain to you what i mean when i think about compassion and why i think it is so important that right at this point in history
we would decide to establish this charter of compassion
the reason it 's important is because this is a very special time in history
it is the time that biblically we would speak of as the day or the year of god 's favor
this is a season of grace
unusual things are beginning to happen
please pardon me as a black man for celebrating that the election of obama was an unusual sign of the fact that it is a year of favor
and yet there is so much more that needs to be done
we need to bring health and food and education and respect for all god 's citizens all god 's children remembering mama eternal
now let me close my comments by telling you that whenever i feel something very deeply it usually takes the form of verse
and so i want to close with a little song
i close with this song it 's a children 's song because we are all children at the table of mama eternal
and if mama eternal has taught us correctly this song will make sense not only to those of us who are a part of this gathering but to all who sign the charter for compassion
and this is why we do it
the song says i made heaven so happy today receiving god 's love and giving it away when i looked up heaven smiled at me now i 'm so happy can 't you see i 'm happy look at me i 'm happy can 't you see sharing makes me happy makes heaven happy too i 'm happy look at me i 'm happy can 't you see let me share my happy loving smile with you that 's compassion
every year in the united states alone 2,077,000 couples make a legal and spiritual decision to spend the rest of their lives together ...
and not to have sex with anyone else ever
he buys a ring she buys a dress
they go shopping for all sorts of things
she takes him to arthur murray for ballroom dancing lessons
and the big day comes
and they 'll stand before god and family and some guy her dad once did business with and they 'll vow that nothing not abject poverty not life-threatening illness not complete and utter misery will ever put the tiniest damper on their eternal love and devotion
these optimistic young bastards promise to honor and cherish each other through hot flashes and mid-life crises and a cumulative 50-lb. weight gain until that far-off day when one of them is finally able to rest in peace
you know because they can 't hear the snoring anymore
and then they 'll get stupid drunk and smash cake in each others faces and do the macarena and we 'll be there showering them with towels and toasters and drinking their free booze and throwing birdseed at them every single time even though we know statistically half of them will be divorced within a decade
of course the other half won 't right
they 'll keep forgetting anniversaries and arguing about where to spend holidays and debating which way the toilet paper should come off of the roll
and some of them will even still be enjoying each others company when neither of them can chew solid food anymore
and researchers want to know why
i mean look it doesn 't take a double-blind placebo-controlled study to figure out what makes a marriage not work
disrespect boredom too much time on facebook having sex with other people
but you can have the exact opposite of all of those things respect excitement a broken internet connection mind-numbing monogamy and the thing still can go to hell in a hand basket
so what 's going on when it doesn 't
what do the folks who make it all the way to side-by-side burial plots have in common
what are they doing right
what can we learn from them
and if you 're still happily sleeping solo why should you stop what you 're doing and make it your life 's work to find that one special person that you can annoy for the rest of your life
well researchers spend billions of your tax dollars trying to figure that out
they stalk blissful couples and they study their every move and mannerism
and they try to pinpoint what it is that sets them apart from their miserable neighbors and friends
and it turns out the success stories share a few similarities actually beyond they don 't have sex with other people
for instance in the happiest marriages the wife is thinner and better looking than the husband
obvious right
it 's obvious that this leads to marital bliss because women we care a great deal about being thin and good looking whereas men mostly care about sex ...
ideally with women who are thinner and better looking than they are
the beauty of this research though is that no one is suggesting that women have to be thin to be happy we just have to be thinner than our partners
so instead of all that laborious dieting and exercising we just need to wait for them to get fat maybe bake a few pies
this is good information to have and it 's not that complicated
research also suggests that the happiest couples are the ones that focus on the positives
for example the happy wife
instead of pointing out her husband 's growing gut or suggesting he go for a run she might say wow honey thank you for going out of your way to make me relatively thinner
these are couples who can find good in any situation
yeah it was devastating when we lost everything in that fire but it 's kind of nice sleeping out here under the stars and it 's a good thing you 've got all that body fat to keep us warm
one of my favorite studies found that the more willing a husband is to do house work the more attractive his wife will find him
because we needed a study to tell us this
but here 's what 's going on here
the more attractive she finds him the more sex they have the more sex they have the nicer he is to her the nicer he is to her the less she nags him about leaving wet towels on the bed and ultimately they live happily ever after
in other words men you might want to pick it up a notch in the domestic department
here 's an interesting one
one study found that people who smile in childhood photographs are less likely to get a divorce
this is an actual study and let me clarify
the researchers were not looking at documented self-reports of childhood happiness or even studying old journals
the data were based entirely on whether people looked happy in these early pictures
now i don 't know how old all of you are but when i was a kid your parents took pictures with a special kind of camera that held something called film and by god film was expensive
they didn 't take 300 shots of you in that rapid-fire digital video mode and then pick out the nicest smileyest one for the christmas card
oh no
they dressed you up they lined you up and you smiled for the fucking camera like they told you to or you could kiss your birthday party goodbye
but still i have a huge pile of fake happy childhood pictures and i 'm glad they make me less likely than some people to get a divorce
so what else can you do to safeguard your marriage
do not win an oscar for best actress
i 'm serious
bettie davis joan crawford hallie berry hillary swank sandra bullock reese witherspoon all of them single soon after taking home that statue
they actually call it the oscar curse
it is the marriage kiss of death and something that should be avoided
and it 's not just successfully starring in films that 's dangerous
it turns out merely watching a romantic comedy causes relationship satisfaction to plummet
apparently the bitter realization that maybe it could happen to us but it obviously hasn 't and it probably never will makes our lives seem unbearably grim in comparison
and theoretically i suppose if we opt for a film where someone gets brutally murdered or dies in a fiery car crash we are more likely to walk out of that theater feeling like we 've got it pretty good
drinking alcohol it seems is bad for your marriage
yeah
i can 't tell you anymore about that one because i stopped reading it at the headline
but here 's a scary one divorce is contagious
that 's right when you have a close couple friend split up it increases your chances of getting a divorce by 75 percent
now i have to say i don 't get this one at all
my husband and i have watched quite a few friends divide their assets and then struggle with being our age and single in an age of sexting and viagra and eharmony
and i 'm thinking they 've done more for my marriage than a lifetime of therapy ever could
so now you may be wondering why does anyone get married ever
well the u.s. federal government counts more than a thousand legal benefits to being someone 's spouse a list that includes visitation rights in jail but hopefully you 'll never need that one
but beyond the profound federal perks married people make more money
we 're healthier physically and emotionally
we produce happier more stable and more successful kids
we have more sex than our supposedly swinging single friends believe it or not
we even live longer which is a pretty compelling argument for marrying someone you like a lot in the first place
now if you 're not currently experiencing the joy of the joint tax return i can 't tell you how to find a chore-loving person of the approximately ideal size and attractiveness who prefers horror movies and doesn 't have a lot of friends hovering on the brink of divorce but i can only encourage you to try because the benefits as i 've pointed out are significant
the bottom line is whether you 're in it or you 're searching for it i believe marriage is an institution worth pursuing and protecting
so i hope you 'll use the information i 've given you today to weigh your personal strengths against your own risk factors
for instance in my marriage i 'd say i 'm doing okay
one the one hand i have a husband who 's annoyingly lean and incredibly handsome
so i 'm obviously going to need fatten him up
and like i said we have those divorced friends who may secretly or subconsciously be trying to break us up
so we have to keep an eye on that
and we do like a cocktail or two
on the other hand i have the fake happy picture thing
and also my husband does a lot around the house and would happily never see another romantic comedy as long as he lives
so i 've got all those things going for me
but just in case i plan to work extra hard to not win an oscar anytime soon
and for the good of your relationships i would encourage you to do the same
i 'll see you at the bar

i have to say that i 'm very glad to be here
i understand we have over 80 countries here so that 's a whole new paradigm for me to speak to all of these countries
in each country i 'm sure you have this thing called the parent-teacher conference
do you know about the parent-teacher conference
not the ones for your kids but the one you had as a child where your parents come to school and your teacher talks to your parents and it 's a little bit awkward
well i remember in third grade i had this moment where my father who never takes off from work he 's a classical blue collar a working-class immigrant person going to school to see his son how he 's doing and the teacher said to him he said you know john is good at math and art
and he kind of nodded you know
the next day i saw him talking to a customer at our tofu store and he said you know john 's good at math
and that always stuck with me all my life
why didn 't dad say art why wasn 't it okay
why it became a question my entire life and that 's all right because being good at math meant he bought me a computer and some of you remember this computer this was my first computer
who had an apple ii apple ii users very cool
as you remember the apple ii did nothing at all
you 'd plug it in you 'd type in it and green text would come out
it would say you 're wrong most of the time
that was the computer we knew
that computer is a computer that i learned about going to mit my father 's dream and at mit however i learned about the computer at all levels and after i went to art school to get away from computers and i began to think about the computer as more of a spiritual space of thinking
and i was influenced by performance art so this is 20 years ago i made a computer out of people
it was called the human powered computer experiment
i have a power manager mouse driver memory etc and i built this in kyoto the old capital of japan
it 's a room broken in two halves
i 've turned the computer on and these assistants are placing a giant floppy disk built out of cardboard and it 's put into the computer
and the floppy disk drive person wears it
she finds the first sector on the disk and takes data off the disk and passes it off to of course the bus
so the bus diligently carries the data into the computer to the memory to the cpu the vram etc and it 's an actual working computer that 's a bus really
and it looks kind of fast that 's a mouse driver where it 's xy
it looks like it 's happening kind of quickly but it 's actually a very slow computer and when i realized how slow this computer was compared to how fast a computer is it made me wonder about computers and technology in general
and so i 'm going to talk today about four things really
the first three things are about how i 've been curious about technology design and art and how they intersect how they overlap and also a topic that i 've taken on since four years ago i became the president of rhode island school of design leadership
and i 'll talk about how i 've looked to combine these four areas into a kind of a synthesis a kind of experiment
so starting from technology technology is a wonderful thing
when that apple ii came out it really could do nothing
it could show text and after we waited a bit we had these things called images
remember when images were first possible with a computer those gorgeous full-color images
and then after a few years we got cd-quality sound
it was incredible you could listen to sound on the computer
and then movies via cd-rom it was amazing
remember that excitement
and then the browser appeared the browser was great but the browser was very primitive very narrow bandwidth
text first then images we waited cd-quality sound over the net then movies over the internet kind of incredible
and then the mobile phone occurred text images audio video and now we have iphone ipad android with text video audio etc
you see this little pattern here
we 're kind of stuck in a loop perhaps and this sense of possibility from computing is something i 've been questioning for the last 10 or so years and have looked to design as we understand most things and to understand design with our technology has been a passion of mine
and i have a small experiment to give you a quick design lesson
designers talk about the relationship between form and content content and form now what does that mean
well content is the word up there fear
it 's a four-letter word it 's a kind of a bad feeling word fear
fear is set in light helvetica so it 's not too stressful and if you set it in ultra light helvetica it 's like oh fear who cares right
you take the same ultra light helvetica and make it big and like whoa that hurts fear
so you can see how you change the scale you change the form content is the same but you feel differently
you change the typeface to like this typeface and it 's kind of funny it 's like pirate typeface like captain jack sparrow typeface arr fear
like aww that 's not fearful that 's actually funny
or fear like this kind of a nightclub typeface
like we gotta go to fear
it 's like amazing right
it just changes the same content
or you make it the letters are separated apart they 're huddled together like on the deck of the titanic and you feel sorry for the letters like i feel the fear
you feel for them
or you change the typeface to something like this
it 's very classy it 's like that expensive restaurant fear
i can never get in there
it 's just amazing fear but that 's form content
if you just change one letter in that content you get a much better word much better content free
free is a great word you can serve it almost any way
free bold feels like mandela free
it 's like yes i can be free
free even light feels kind of like ah i can breathe in free
it feels great or even free spread out it 's like ah i can breathe in free so easily
and i can add in a blue gradient and a dove and i have like don draper free
so you see that form content design it works that way
it 's a powerful thing it 's like magic almost like the magicians we 've seen at ted it 's magic
design does that
and i 've been curious about how design and technology intersect and i 'm going to show you some old work i never really show anymore to give you a sense of what i used to do
so yeah
so i made a lot of work in the 90s
this was a square that responds to sound
people ask me why i made that it 's not clear
but i thought it 'd be neat for the square to respond to me and my kids were small then and my kids would play with these things like aaah you know they would say daddy aaah aaah you know like that
we 'd go to a computer store and they 'd do the same thing
and they 'd say daddy why doesn 't the computer respond to sound
and it was really at the time i was wondering why doesn 't the computer respond to sound
so i made this as a kind of an experiment at the time
and then i spent a lot of time in the space of interactive graphics and things like this and i stopped doing it because my students at mit got so much better than myself so i had to hang up my mouse
but in 96 i made my last piece it was in black and white monochrome fully monochrome all in integer mathematics
it 's called tap type write
it 's paying a tribute to the wonderful typewriter that my mother used to type on all the time as a legal secretary
it has 10 variations
there 's a shift
ten variations this is like spin the letter around
this is like a ring of letters
this is 20 years old so it 's kind of a let 's see this is i love the french film the red balloon
great movie right i love that movie so this is sort of like a play on that
it 's peaceful like that
i 'll show this last one this is about balance you know
it 's kind of stressful typing out so if you type on this keyboard you can like balance it out
if you hit g life 's okay so i always say hit g and it 's going to be all right
thank you
thank you
so that was 20 years ago and i was always on the periphery of art
by being president of risd i 've gone deep into art and art is a wonderful thing fine art pure art
you know when people say i don 't get art
i don 't get it at all that means art is working you know
it 's like art is supposed to be enigmatic so when you say like i don 't get it like oh that 's great
art does that because art is about asking questions questions that may not be answerable
at risd we have this amazing facility called the edna lawrence nature lab it has 80,000 samples of animal bone mineral plants
you know in rhode island if an animal gets hit on the road they call us up and we pick it up and stuff it
and why do we have this facility
because at risd you have to look at the actual animal the object to understand its volume to perceive it
at risd you 're not allowed to draw from an image
and many people ask me john couldn 't you just digitize all this make it all digital wouldn 't it be better
and i often say well there 's something good to how things used to be done there 's something very different about it something we should figure out what is good about how we did it even in this new era
and i have a good friend he 's a new media artist named tota hasegawa he 's based in london no actually it 's in tokyo but when he was based in london he had a game with his wife he would go to antique shops and the game was as such when we look at an antique we want we 'll ask the shopkeeper for the story behind the antique and if it 's a good story we 'll buy it
so they 'd go to an antique shop and they 'd look at this cup and they 'd say tell us about this cup
and the shopkeeper would say it 's old
tell us more oh it 's really old
and he saw over and over the antique 's value was all about it being old
and as a new media artist he reflected and said you know i 've spent my whole career making new media art
people say wow your art what is it it 's new media
and he realized it isn 't about old or new
it 's about something in between
it isn 't about old the dirt new the cloud it 's about what is good
a combination of the cloud and the dirt is where the action is at
you see it in all interesting art today in all interesting businesses today how we combine those two together to make good is very interesting
so art makes questions and leadership is something that is asking a lot of questions
we aren 't functioning so easily anymore
we aren 't a simple authoritarian regime anymore
as an example of authoritarianism i was in russia one time traveling in st. petersburg at a national monument and i saw this sign that says do not walk on the grass and i thought oh i mean i speak english and you 're trying to single me out that 's not fair
but i found a sign for russian-speaking people and it was the best sign ever to say no
it was like no swimming no hiking no anything
my favorite ones are no plants why would you bring a plant to a national monument i 'm not sure
and also no love
so that is authoritarianism
and what is that structurally
it 's a hierarchy we all know that a hierarchy is how we run many systems today but as we know it 's been disrupted
it is now a network instead of a perfect tree
it 's a heterarchy instead of a hierarchy and that 's kind of awkward
and so today leaders are faced with how to lead differently i believe
this is work i did with my colleague becky bermont on creative leadership what can we learn from artists and designers for how to lead
because in many senses a regular leader loves to avoid mistakes
someone who 's creative actually loves to learn from mistakes
a traditional leader is always wanting to be right whereas a creative leader hopes to be right
and this frame is important today in this complex ambiguous space and artists and designers have a lot to teach us i believe
and i had a show in london recently where my friends invited me to come to london for four days to sit in a sandbox and i said great
and so i sat in a sandbox for four days straight six hours every day six-minute appointments with anyone in london and that was really bad
but i would listen to people hear their issues draw in the sand try to figure things out and it was kind of hard to figure out what i was doing
you know it 's all these one-on-one meetings for like four days
and it felt kind of like being president actually
i was like oh this my job president i do a lot of meetings you know
and by the end of the experience i realized why i was doing this
it 's because leaders what we do is we connect improbable connections and hope something will happen and in that room i found so many connections between people across all of london and so leadership connecting people is the great question today
whether you 're in the hierarchy or the heterarchy it 's a wonderful design challenge
and one thing i 've been doing is doing some research on systems that can combine technology and leadership with an art and design perspective
let me show you something i haven 't shown anywhere actually
so what this is is a kind of a sketch an application sketch i wrote in python you know how there 's photoshop
this is called powershop and the way it works is imagine an organization you know the ceo isn 't ever at the top the ceo 's at the center of the organization
there may be different subdivisions in the organization and you might want to look into different areas for instance green are areas doing well red are areas doing poorly
you know how do you as the leader scan connect make things happen so for instance you might open up a distribution here and find the different subdivisions in there and know that you know someone in eco over here and these people here are in eco the people you might engage with as ceo people going across the hierarchy
and part of the challenge of the ceo is to find connections across areas and so you might look in r & amp d and here you see one person who crosses the two areas of interest and it 's a person important to engage
so you might want to for instance get a heads-up display on how you 're interacting with them
how many coffees do you have
how often are you calling them emailing them
what is the tenor of their email how is it working out
leaders might be able to use these systems to better regulate how they work inside the heterarchy
you can also imagine using technology like from luminoso the guys from cambridge who were looking at deep text analysis what is the tenor of your communications
so these kind of systems i believe are important
they 're targeted social media systems around leaders
and i believe that this kind of perspective will only begin to grow as more leaders enter the space of art and design because art and design lets you think like this find different systems like this and i 've just begun thinking like this so i 'm glad to share that with you
so in closing i want to thank all of you for your attention thanks very much
my name is emiliano salinas and i 'm going to talk about the role we members of society play in the violent atmosphere this country is living in right now
i was born in 1976
i grew up in a traditional mexican family
as a child i had a pretty normal life i would go to school play with my friends and cousins
but then my father became president of mexico and my life changed
what i 'm about to say at least some of what i 'm about to say will cause controversy
firstly because i 'm the one who 's going to say it
and secondly because what i 'm going to say is true and it will make a lot of people nervous because it 's something we don 't want to hear
but it 's imperative that we listen because it 's undeniable and definitive
it will also make members of criminal organizations nervous for the same reasons
i 'm going to talk about the role we members of society play in this phenomenon and about four different response levels we citizens have against violence
i know many will find it difficult to separate the fact that i 'm carlos salinas de gortari 's son from the fact that i 'm a citizen concerned about the country 's current situation
don 't worry
it 's not necessary for understanding the importance of what i 'm going to say
i think we have a problem in mexico
we have a big problem
i think there 's consensus on this
no one argues we all agree there 's a problem
what we don 't agree on is what the problem actually is
is it the zetas the drug traffickers the government
corruption poverty or is it something else
i think none of these is the problem
i don 't mean they don 't deserve attention
but we won 't be able to take care of any of those things if we don 't solve the real problem we have in mexico first
the real problem we have is most of us mexicans we believe we are victims of our circumstances
we are a country of victims
historically we 've always acted as victims of something or somebody
we were victims of the spaniards
then we were victims of the french
then we were victims of don porfirio
then we were victims of the pri
even of salinas
and of el peje
and now of the zetas and the traffickers and the criminals and the kidnappers ...
hold on wait a minute
what if none of these things is the problem
the problem is not the things we feel victims of
the problem is that we play the role of victims
we need to open our eyes and see that we are not victims
if only we stopped feeling like victims if we stopped acting as victims our country would change so much
i 'm going to talk about how to go from a society that acts as a victim of circumstances to a responsible involved society that takes the future of its country in its own hands
i 'm going to talk about four different levels of civil response against violence from weakest to strongest
the first level the weakest level of civil response against violence is denial and apathy
today much of mexican society is in denial of the situation we 're going through
we want to go on with our daily life even though we are not living under normal circumstances
daily life in our country is to say the least under extraordinary exceptional circumstances
it 's like someone who has a serious illness and pretends it 's the flu and it will just go away
we want to pretend that mexico has the flu
but it doesn 't
mexico has cancer
and if we don 't do something about it the cancer will end up killing it
we need to move mexican society from denial and apathy to the next level of citizen response which is effectively recognition
and that recognition will sow fear recognizing the seriousness of the situation
but fear is better than apathy because fear makes us do something
many people in mexico are afraid today
we 're very afraid
and we 're acting out of that fear
and let me tell you what the problem is with acting out of fear and this is the second level of civil response fear
let 's think about mexican streets they 're unsafe because of violence so people stay at home
does that make streets more or less safe
less safe
so streets become more desolate and unsafe so we stay home more which makes streets even more desolate and unsafe and we stay home even more
this vicious circle ends up with the whole population stuck inside their houses scared to death even more afraid than when we were out on the streets
we need to confront this fear
we need to move mexican society the members of society who are at this level to the next level which is action
we need to face our fears and take back our streets our cities our neighborhoods
for many people acting involves courage
we go from fear to courage
they say i can 't take it anymore
let 's do something about it
recently this is a sensitive figure 35 public lynchings have been recorded so far in 2010 in mexico
usually it 's one or two a year
now we 're experiencing one every week
this shows that society is desperate and it 's taking the law into its own hands
unfortunately violent action though action is better than no action but taking part in it only disguises violence
if i 'm violent with you and you respond with violence you become part of the violence and you just disguise my violence
so civil action is vital but it 's also vital to take people who are at the level of courage and violent action to the next level which is non-violent action
it 's pacific coordinated civil action which doesn 't mean passive action
it means it 's determined and effective but not violent
there are examples of this kind of action in mexico
two years ago in galena city chihuahua a member of the community was kidnapped eric le barón
his brothers benjamín and julián got together with the rest of the community to think of the best course of action to pay the ransom to take up arms and go after the kidnappers or to ask the government for help
in the end benjamín and julián decided the best thing they could do was to organize the community and act together
so what did they do
they mobilized the whole community of le barón to go to chihuahua where they organized a sit-in in the central park of the city
they sent a message to the kidnappers if you want your ransom come and get it
we 'll be waiting for you right here
they stayed there
seven days later eric was set free and was able to return home
this is an example of what an organized society can do a society that acts
of course criminals can respond
and in this case they did
on july 7th 2009 benjamín le barón was murdered
but julián le barón keeps working and he has been mobilizing communities in chihuahua for over a year
and for over a year he has known that a price has been put on his head
but he keeps fighting
he keeps organizing
he keeps mobilizing
these heroic acts are present all over the country
with a thousand juliáns working together mexico would be a very different country
and they 're out there
they just have to raise their hands
i was born in mexico i grew up in mexico and along the way i learned to love mexico
i think anyone who has stepped foot on this land not to mention all mexican people will agree that it 's not difficult to love mexico
i 've traveled a lot and nowhere else have i found the passion mexicans have
that devotion we feel for the national football team
that devotion we show in helping victims of disasters such as the earthquake in 1985 or this year 's floods
the passion with which we 've been singing the national anthem since we were kids
when we thought masiosare was the strange enemy and we sang with a childlike heart a soldier in each son
i think the biggest insult the worst way you can offend a mexican is to insult their mother
a mother is the most sacred thing in life
mexico is our mother and today she cries out for her children
we are going through the darkest moment in our recent history
our mother mexico is being violated before our very eyes
what are we going to do
masiosare the strange enemy is here
where is the soldier in each son
mahatma gandhi one of the greatest civil fighters of all time said be the change you wish to see in the world
today in mexico we 're asking for gandhis
we need ghandis
we need men and women who love mexico and who are willing to take action
this is a call for every true mexican to join this initiative
this is a call so that every single thing we love about mexico the festivals the markets the restaurants the cantinas the tequila the mariachis the serenades the posadas el grito the day of the dead san miguel the joy the passion for life the fight and everything it means to be mexican doesn 't disappear from this world
we 're facing a very powerful opponent
but we are many more
they can take a man 's life
anyone can kill me or you or you
but no one can kill the spirit of true mexicans
the battle is won but we still have to fight it
2000 years ago the roman poet juvenal said something that today echoes in the heart of every true mexican
he said count it the greatest sin to prefer life to honor and for the sake of living to lose what makes life worth living
thank you

good morning
are you awake
they took my name tag but i wanted to ask you did anyone here write their name on the tag in arabic
anyone no one all right no problem
once upon a time not long ago i was sitting in a restaurant with my friend ordering food
so i looked at the waiter and said do you have a menu
he looked at me strangely thinking that he misheard
he said sorry
i said the menu please
he replied don 't you know what they call it
i do
he said no it 's called menu or menu
is the french pronunciation correct
come come take care of this one said the waiter
he was disgusted when talking to me as if he was saying to himself if this was the last girl on earth i wouldn 't look at her
what 's the meaning of saying menu in arabic
two words made a lebanese young man judge a girl as being backward and ignorant
how could she speak that way
at that moment i started thinking
it made me mad
it definitely hurts
i 'm denied the right to speak my own language in my own country
where could this happen
how did we get here
well while we are here there are many people like me who would reach a stage in their lives where they involuntarily give up everything that has happened to them in the past just so they can say that they 're modern and civilized
should i forget all my culture thoughts intellect and all my memories
childhood stories might be the best memories we have of the war
should i forget everything i learned in arabic just to conform
to be one of them
where 's the logic in that
despite all that i tried to understand him
i didn 't want to judge him with the same cruelty that he judged me
the arabic language doesn 't satisfy today 's needs
it 's not a language for science research a language we 're used to in universities a language we use in the workplace a language we rely on if we were to perform an advanced research project and it definitely isn 't a language we use at the airport
if we did so they 'd strip us of our clothes
where can i use it then we could all ask this question
so you want us to use arabic where are we to do so
this is one reality
but we have another more important reality that we ought to think about
arabic is the mother tongue
research says that mastery of other languages demands mastery of the mother tongue
mastery of the mother tongue is a prerequisite for creative expression in other languages
how
gibran khalil gibran when he first started writing he used arabic
all his ideas imagination and philosophy were inspired by this little boy in the village where he grew up smelling a specific smell hearing a specific voice and thinking a specific thought
so when he started writing in english he had enough baggage
even when he wrote in english when you read his writings in english you smell the same smell sense the same feeling
you can imagine that that 's him writing in english the same boy who came from the mountain from a village on mount lebanon
so this is an example no one can argue with
second it 's often said that if you want to kill a nation the only way to kill a nation is to kill its language
this is a reality that developed societies are aware of
the germans french japanese and chinese all these nations are aware of this
