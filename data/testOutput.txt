it will change the way we interact with people also not only the physical world
the fun part is i 'm going to the boston metro and playing a pong game inside the train on the ground right
and i think the imagination is the only limit of what you can think of when this kind of technology merges with real life
but many of you argue actually that all of our work is not only about physical objects
we actually do lots of accounting and paper editing
and all those kinds of things what about that and many of you are excited about the next generation tablet computers to come out in the market
so rather than waiting for that i actually made my own just using a piece of paper
so what i did here is remove the camera all the webcam cameras have a microphone inside the camera

i removed the microphone from that and then just pinched that like i just made a clip out of the microphone and clipped that to a piece of paper any paper that you found around
so now the sound of the touch is getting me when exactly i 'm touching the paper
but the camera is actually tracking where my fingers are moving
you can of course watch movies and i am a wilderness explorer in tribe 54
and you can of course play games
here the camera is actually understanding how you 're holding the paper and playing a car-racing game
many of you already must have thought ok you can browse
yeah of course you can browse to any websites or you can do all sorts of computing on a piece of paper wherever you need it
so more interestingly i 'm interested in how we can take that in a more dynamic way

when i come back to my desk i can just pinch that information back to my desktop
so i can use my full-size computer and why only computers we can just play with papers paper world is interesting to play with here
i 'm taking a part of a document and putting over here a second part from a second place
and i 'm actually modifying the information that i have over there
yeah and i say ok this looks nice
let me print it out that thing
so i now have a print-out of that thing and now the workflow is more intuitive the way
we used to do it maybe 20 years back rather than now switching between these two worlds
so as a last thought i think that integrating information to everyday objects will not only help us to get rid of the digital divide
the gap between these two worlds but will also help us in some way to stay human to be more connected to our physical world
and it will actually help us not end up being machines sitting in front of other machines
